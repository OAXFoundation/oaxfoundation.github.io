The code for our Layer 2 Exchange (L2X) protocol is officially released, marking the completion of a major milestone for the project.

Currently, digital asset trading either takes place on centralized exchanges, which have persistently proved vulnerable to hacking, or in decentralized environments, which have speed and governance issues. OAX Foundation, working with its development partner, Enuma Technologies, has built a trustless exchange platform that combines the best elements of each system.
