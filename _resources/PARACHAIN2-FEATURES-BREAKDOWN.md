When we first set out to decide which features we should be coding for, the team evaluated what was currently existing within the network, and what we felt would actually address the needs of the community that would actually be using the network in the future.

PRC20 feature was necessary to be done on a foundational level so the work could begin, while the Burn feature existed for token economic management. While less exciting, these were necessary from an operational standpoint. Find out more about our other features, Atomic Swap, Fee Delegation, and MultiTransfer in our features breakdown below!
