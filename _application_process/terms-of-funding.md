Financial considerations for the grant request should be provided. What is the total amount, and/or how will the payment be distributed? For larger grant requests, the team will likely use staggered distribution of funds tagged to key milestones and deliverables. 

While the OAX Foundation Grant primarily focuses on monetary grant support, the Foundation will work with the individuals/companies that are recipients of the grant to monitor the progress. On an informal basis, we will do our best to provide support and connect recipients to industry resources as and when necessary.
