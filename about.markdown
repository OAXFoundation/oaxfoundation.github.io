The Foundation’s deep-seated beliefs for the collaborative nature of decentralized finance has served as a basis of engagement for working with key players in the space to explore and push the potential of technology.

In early 2024, we’ve successfully launched the OAX Academy initiative to further provide newcomers and existing users of the digital assets space with useful resources, support and guides.

                <div class="section--description">What the end goal looks like for digital assets remains unknown, and to spell it out may do a disservice of limiting its potential. OAX Foundation believes that the journey for digital assets includes DeFi and have been working to support its development.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Through working on features developing for the Polkadot Network, to working with like minded industry institutions, DeFi remains the promise of the industry, and will open doors to many future features.

We continue to strive to bring tools that leverage decentralization and working with partners to drive a stronger use case.
