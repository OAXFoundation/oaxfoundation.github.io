        <p class="page-subheading col">OAX Foundation set out in 2017 with the conviction that decentralized finance and digital assets would be an integral part of the future of mainstream finance and commerce. The Foundation’s deep-seated beliefs for the collaborative nature of decentralized finance has served as a basis of engagement for working with key players in the space to explore and push the potential of technology.

                    digital assets to flourish. While roadmaps and timelines constantly shift, we believe that the work often needs to be offered with transparency, ensuring that it’s being driven in the right direction and with the feedback of the community.

                <div class="section--description">What the end goal looks like for digital assets remains unknown, and to spell it out may do a disservice of limiting its potential. OAX Foundation believes that the journey for digital assets includes DeFi and have been working to support its development.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Through working on features developing for the Polkadot Network, to working with like minded industry institutions, DeFi remains the promise of the industry, and will open doors to many future features.

                    <br/><br/>
                    OAX Foundation always has their door open to hear from parties that share alignment in our values and have ideas on how we can
                    further integrate decentralization into the digital asset age.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Overarching areas that the Foundation does focus on as part of their considerations:
                    <br/><br/>
                    1) DeFi Driven Values<br/>
                    2) Solid Track-Record and Expertise<br/>
                    3) Range of OAX support (Expertise, Utility)<br/>
                    4) Economical Resourcing<br/>
                    5) Addressing Key Industry Challenges<br/>
