                <div class="section--description">What the end goal looks like for digital finance remains unknown, and to spell it out may do a disservice of limiting its potential. OAX Foundation believes that the journey for digital assets includes DeFi and has been working to support its development. <br/><br/> From developing features for the Polkadot Network to collaborating with like-minded industry institutions, DeFi continues to hold immense promise for the industry. It has evolved within the Web3 ecosystem, leveraging emerging AI technologies to address its challenges and unlock new potential. <br/><br/>Learn more about the potential of DeFi in some of our thought pieces.</div>

While roadmaps and timelines constantly shift, we believe that the work often needs to be offered with transparency, ensuring that it’s being driven in the right direction and with the feedback of the community. <br/><br/>The launch of our Notifs app pulls information available from blockchain and in the public domain to consolidate and provide relevant information to your specific portfolio.
