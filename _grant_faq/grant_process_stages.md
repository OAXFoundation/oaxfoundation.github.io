Stage 1: Submission of Grant Proposal

Stage 2: Review Process
Proposals of interest to OAX Foundation will get follow up interview(s), where the team will be asked for clarifications and/or finetuning of deliverables etc. There is no set timeframe for the review stage, however, prompt and responsive communications will ensure a speedier process.

Stage 3: Confirmation and Approval Process
Once successful applicants receive a grant offer from OAX Foundation, the team/company will undergo an onboarding stage which will require KYC/AML checks. Applicants must successfully complete the Onboarding stage before agreements are signed for the Grant.
