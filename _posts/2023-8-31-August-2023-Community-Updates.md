<br><b>August 2023 Community Updates</b>

Hi OAX community,

Welcome back to our community blog! Let's dive into the highlights of the latest developments in the month of August.

Despite the market’s volatility, we have witnessed some remarkable progress in exploring use cases in the crypto space. As we have <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/08/23/Considering-the-Importance-of-Consumer-Feedback-in-Driving-Innovation.html">written</a> a deep dive on how consumers voice is key to innovation earlier this month, we are seeing Shopify's integration with Solana Pay, empowering merchants with powerful Web3 commerce features, and the rise of Friend.tech on Coinbase's layer 2 network: BASE, captivating both users and renowned figures with its social media tokenization. Pushing the boundaries further, the introduction of the BoLD permissionless validation protocol in Arbitrum has significantly strengthened security and decentralization in Ethereum scaling. While from the recent Grayscale win against the SEC, we’re seeing positivity in the digital asset space.

Building upon last month's exciting <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/07/31/July-2023-Community-Updates.html">announcement</a> of multi-chain asset tracking, this month we are thrilled to unveil a significant UI upgrade that provides our users with a comprehensive and streamlined view of their assets across multiple chains, all rolling up to a master portfolio.

Also, a shout out to everyone who participated in our <a href="https://twitter.com/OAX_Foundation/status/1690994320009252865">poll</a>! We wanted to know which EVM-compatible chain is the most popular among our community members, and it does seem like Polygon is extra popular. For those of you who voted ‘others’, rest assured we have other integrations in mind for future rollouts of the Notifs App experience - you’ll have to stay tuned for our coming updates as we go along. 

Coming up in September, OAX Foundation will participate in the renowned TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore, where industry leaders and enthusiasts gather to explore the latest advancements in blockchain technology. We are eager to take this opportunity to showcase our latest features of our project - Notifs, and get feedback on the ground as well as discover new partnerships for our next stage. In addition, we are always looking out for new opportunities to onboard our next project.
