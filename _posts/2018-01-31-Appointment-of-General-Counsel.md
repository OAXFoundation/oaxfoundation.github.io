Today we're pleased to announce the appointment of Paul Li as General Counsel  to the OAX Foundation, marking an important stage in the development of our legal and regulatory function. 

Paul was previously in the Financial Regulation Group at Linklaters in Hong Kong. Here, he advised his clients on a wide variety of matters concerning compliance with local and international regulatory requirements, corporate transactions and the licensing of financial services businesses. He also brings with him experience of working with international regulators on investigations at both retail and institutional firms.

Before joining Linklaters, Paul worked at a leading Australian law firm. During his time there, he was seconded to the in-house team of a major financial institution where he helped advise on the firm's response to major regulatory investigations and changes in Austalian privacy laws. He has also lectured on regulatory issues at both the University of Syden and the University of Hong Kong. 

Transparency and governance are core parts of the OAX project. As we updated the community last week, at our recent Working Group session [Here](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/our-second-working-group-development-plans-and-regulatory-policies-e01561de2e36), the members spent much of their time discussing approaches to anti-money laundering, know your customer and counter-terrorist financing policies. Getting the governance right in these, and all other regulatory, areas is crucial to ensuring the acceptance and successful adoption of our platform. Paul’s experience working across international regulatory environments will help us achieve this goal.

As we move into February we feel we’ve got some serious momentum growing behind our activities. We’re building a strong team with the right experience and focus to ensure delivery of the OAX project, and are looking forward to sharing more of that with you.
