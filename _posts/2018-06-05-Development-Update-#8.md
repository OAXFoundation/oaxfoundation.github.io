At Consensus in New York last month, we demo to attendees the preliminary version of the OAX platform prototype, which brought us a lot of useful insights and feedback.

Earlier this week, our team at the OAX Foundation and development partner Enuma Technologies met again to discuss the project’s progress. We’re now pleased to say that the prototype is on track for a general release by the end of June, an important milestone as stated in our [whitepaper](https://www.oax.org/assets/whitepaper/openANX_White_Paper_ENU.pdf).

While the Enuma team are now busy deploying the prototype for code auditing, they have also released it internally for the OAX team to test out. And Last but not least, our marketing team are planning various marketing activities to engage the community — videos, articles, media exposure, local meet up, online AMA sessions and more — creating more channels to exchange ideas and gather feedback. Stay tuned!
