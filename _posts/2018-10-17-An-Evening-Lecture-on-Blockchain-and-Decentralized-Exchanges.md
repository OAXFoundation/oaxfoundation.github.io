This evening, [Kelvin Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvin-wong-90aa002/) — our head of branding and communications — went to City University of Hong Kong to help teach a blockchain course hosted by the ANX Academy. Regular readers will know this is not the first time we’ve done something like this — in fact, our team members regularly present on topics related to digital asset trading. It’s all a part of our mission to help bring transparency and greater understanding to the industry.

At today’s course, Kelvin introduced the decentralized exchange concept to about 150 students, describing the benefits it brings to the crypto market as well as the challenges facing its mass adoption. As you’ll be aware by now, decentralization means users have greater control over their own assets and the risk of hacking is greatly reduced compared to a centralized environment. But speed and volume remain issues that make performance levels a concern (and which aren’t problems faced by centralized exchanges).

That’s where the OAX platform comes in, of course — and the second half of Kelvin’s presentation gave an overview of the project, its aims and objectives. Through the use of innovative technologies we aim to combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges, solving the challenges of both and bringing decentralization into the mainstream.

As the project progresses we feel it’s more important than ever to get our message out there — educating the public about how decentralization will shape the future of the financial services industry, and the important role we believe the OAX project will play in doing that. The interest and enthusiasm shown by Kelvin’s audience tonight makes us feel very confident about both!
