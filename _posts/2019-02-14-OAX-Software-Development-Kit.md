To coincide with [the recent release of our DEX platform to the Rinkeby testnet](https://cryptobriefing.com/oax-dex-mass-adoption/), we’re proud to [announce the availability of our software development kit (SDK)](https://www.oax.org/en/testnet-announcement).

This SDK allows the user to interact with [our DEX platform](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/hong-kong-dex-trading-platform-oax-announces-scaling-protocol-to-spur-mass-user-adoption/) using its built-in command line interface, or developers can use the provided API to integrate it into a UI or their own applications.

We’ve already published the OAX client as an [NPM module](https://github.com/OAXFoundation/oax-client).

For installation instructions, refer to our Github repository:
[https://github.com/OAXFoundation/oax-client](https://github.com/OAXFoundation/oax-client)

Requirements:

Current version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v11.9.0 at time of writing).

Here’s a video demonstrating the installation of use of the client:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=288&v=KxcgBZJpOww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=288&v=KxcgBZJpOww)
