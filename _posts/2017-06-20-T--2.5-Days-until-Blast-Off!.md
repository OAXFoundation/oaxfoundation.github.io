Hi guys, we are in the home stretch in terms of project launch, with a lot of stuff happening all at once!

First, it’s IMPORTANT to let everyone know we’ve been in touch with a few other projects and together we are seeing an increase in SCAM activity. Do not under any circumstances give or share ETH or BTC (or any other crypto addresses) via our channels. All official business will go via [www.openanx.org](www.openanx.org).

Next, on to the fun stuff. We are working hard to make the project and launch as easy and user-friendly as possible. We’ve been getting the word out in the press and have had a lot of coverage in the last 48 hours.

All really good stuff, few of the general media had some trouble understanding the intricacies of the project, but overall they got how excited we are, and that’s great.

As we mentioned yesterday, the openANX team are doing 5 Cities in 5 Days, and participating in Meetup’s, attending forums and having discussions in;

**Chengdu, China**

**Shanghai, China**

**Seoul, South Korea**

**Hong Kong**

**Singapore**

Shanghai, Seoul and Hong Kong run today (20 June) in the evening, if you’re interested in any of these events, jump on the Slack channel. Singapore will be Wednesday (21).

Later today (HK Time) we will be posting some videos of the event and launching the User Guide, a simple step-by-step guide to help people get involved. 

That's it for now, stay tuned!
