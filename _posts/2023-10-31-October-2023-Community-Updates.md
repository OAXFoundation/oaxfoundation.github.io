<br><b>October 2023 Community Updates</b>

Hey everyone,

We're thrilled to share some exciting updates with you all. The recent surge in Bitcoin's price, briefly touching $35,000, has brought a sense of optimism to the market. It raises the question of whether this is a sign of the bearish sentiment from the crypto winter starting to alleviate.

We recently attended ETH HK at Cyberport, and it was inspiring to see some of the brightest minds and thought leaders come together to discuss the tremendous opportunities presented by Ethereum here in Hong Kong. We were thrilled to join the conversation and meet fellow participants in person on how the latest technology advancements on scalability, interoperability and security can shape the future of web3.

As we look ahead, we're excited about the upcoming Fintech Week in HK. This event will bring together global players to discuss the potential of Web3 and the opportunities it presents for the financial sector. One of the projects we support, <a href="https://www.notifs.co">Notifs</a>, will also be co-hosting an official side event during Fintech Week. They'll be connecting with attendees and sharing updates on their latest product developments, revealing advancements such as AI-powered news summary, enhanced user interfaces, and support for new languages.

Lastly, we'd like to wish everyone who celebrates a happy Halloween! We hope you have a fantastic time filled with fun and spooktacular moments.
