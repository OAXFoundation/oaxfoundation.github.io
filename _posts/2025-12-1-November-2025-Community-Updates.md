<br><b>November 2025 Community Updates</b>

We’ve all witnessed a devastating market correction in Nov. Crypto’s total market cap dipped below $3T from its recent $4T peak, triggered by heavy liquidations, lingering macro uncertainty, and doubts over rate cuts. 

Yet as Polymarket odds flipped firmly toward lower rates in the past week, there's a silver lining of a year end rebound. Bitcoin now sits at a critical juncture, a decisive push above key technical levels could spark a continuation in the bullish cycle.

While broader equities keep climbing on AI-driven optimism despite softer job data. Through the volatility, one thing remains crystal clear, building in AI is the next track to growth. From deeper collaborations and strategic partnerships to backing the brightest builders, the OAX Foundation is charging forward on all fronts. Here’s a recap of this action packed month.

<b>Momentum from Hong Kong Fintech Week</b>

As covered in mini writeups throughout the month, one of the more notable announcements unveiled by the <b>Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)</b> at the <b>Hong Kong FinTech Week 2025</b> was "Fintech 2030," a visionary five-year strategy designed to propel the city into the forefront of global financial innovation. 

Building on the successes of the 2021 Fintech 2025 roadmap, this ambitious plan centers on the "DART" framework: <b>Data and payment infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence, Resilience, and Tokenization</b>, encompassing over 40 initiatives to foster a sustainable, inclusive ecosystem.

Hong Kong’s growth and support of innovation continues to inspire us, and we continue to be committed to our vision of doing what we can to contribute.

<b>Cyberport is Walking the Talk</b>

Hong Kong FinTech Week reached fever pitch as the <b>Cyberport Venture Capital Forum 2025</b> delivered two high-energy days of AI and Web3 breakthroughs. Day 1 spotlighted AI-powered FinTech and real-world asset tokenisation, with standout projects demonstrating stablecoin use in real estate, asset management, and loyalty programs, while Day 2’s Web3 Innovation Expo featured Dr Rocky Cheng (Cyberport CEO), Under Secretary Joseph Chan JP, and Solana Company’s Joseph Chee championing Hong Kong’s rise as Asia’s digital-asset bridge. Live updates from Cyberport’s Blockchain Pilot Subsidy Scheme showcased first-cohort successes with real traction and corporate partnerships, alongside deep dives into DID, IoT-blockchain integration, and maturing stablecoin infrastructure, solidifying Hong Kong’s leadership in responsible innovation and sparking fresh collaboration opportunities across the ecosystem.

<b>Time to Build with AWS Kiro</b>

We dropped by the “Vibe Coding Production-Ready Agents with Kiro” workshop at the AWS Hong Kong office today and came away buzzing. The hands-on session dove deep into Kiro, a powerful AI-powered IDE, showing participants how to rapidly evolve from fun “vibe coding” prototypes to robust, production-ready AI agents built on Amazon Bedrock and Strands Agents. It was a perfect reminder that in today’s fast-moving tech landscape, staying curious and constantly upskilling is the ultimate superpower.

<b>Venturing into AI applications: GMAsia</b>

As we’ve highlighted in a blog post earlier this month, we’re also incredibly excited to announce our support of a new project, <a href="https://gmasia.ai/">GMAsia</a>. While GMAsia is still in its early stages and in beta mode, the team is thrilled to be BUIDLing new features to enhance and grow the GMAsia ecosystem. It’s not meant to be just an events calendar, but a meaningful point of connection for everyone in the growing Web3 and AI space.

<b>People First Innovation Always</b>

At our core, we are a “People First, Innovation Always” foundation. Proudly recognized by the MPF Schemes Authority as an Award-Winning Employer, we’ve earned the prestigious Good MPF Employer Award for our unwavering commitment to employee care and well-being. We firmly believe that true ecosystem growth and groundbreaking innovation begin when people thrive. 

<b>Closing thoughts: Bittersweet Start to December</b>

November reminded us that markets can swing, yet our focus never wavers: we keep building, partnering, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI and Web3. 

The energy at Hong Kong’s flagship events this month reaffirmed the city’s unstoppable momentum as Asia’s innovation hub, and we’re proud to be right at the heart of it, supporting builders, nurturing home-grown breakthroughs, and expanding our reach with GMAsia as the spearhead of our AI journey. 
Some paths naturally evolve along the way, but every step forward strengthens the ecosystem we all believe in. The best is still ahead, and we’re more committed than ever to making it happen together.
