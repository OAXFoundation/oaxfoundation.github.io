<br><b>OAX Foundation: Powering AI & Web3's Next Wave</b>

<b><i>We're not slowing down. We're accelerating.</i></b>

<b>The Infrastructure Builders</b>

The OAX Foundation has been powering the digital asset ecosystem via supporting builders. We've accelerated the developments of Polkadot’s ecosystem features, L2 scaling solution, real-time market notification infrastructure, a decentralized digital asset protocol and the list goes on. But we've only just begun.

<b>Introducing GMAsia: Web3's Networking Hub</b>

<b><a href="https://gmasia.ai/">GMAsia</a></b> is an <b>AI-powered platform</b> connecting Web3 communities across Asia and beyond. Scattered events? Fragmented networks? No more.

We are very excited to announce the <b>Beta version of GMAsia</b> is live today. 

<b><i>What is GMAsia?</i></b> Currently, GMAsia is a unified events calendar featuring conferences, hackathons, and networking drinks for Asia, all in one place. We’ve also included AI-powered recommendations that will deliver personalized event suggestions based on your interests, location, and network. 

We ourselves attended many events and noticed how segregated event discovery can be, hence we can see how GMAsia will fill a gap for audiences in this growing sector. 

Q1 2026 brings the full platform launch with a ton of features in the pipeline that we hope to bring to life. Beyond event discovery, GMAsia’s ambition is to become a Web3 Resource Hub and Platform. The potential is certainly immense, GMAsia’s future could include a <b>talent marketplace</b>, full-fledged <b>Web3 directory collaboration platform</b>, <b>learning academy</b>, and more <b>AI-integrated</b> features. 

<b>Why GMAsia Matters Now</b>

We’re observing several tailwinds that are converging. Regulatory clarity globally has paved the way for TradFi giants to begin exploring building in Web3. Along with the cultural shift for Gen Z, being more experimental with digital assets, this signals a new need for infrastructure to navigate this emerging landscape.

In summary, with a growing community worldwide, particularly in Asia, demand for Web3 collaboration is more important than ever. GMAsia plays a critical role in the sector, aiming to foster greater collaboration, starting with better ways of connecting people through conferences and events that matter.

<b>The Bigger Picture: More AI-Web3 Coming</b>

GMAsia is step one of our AI-Web3 push. We're actively scouting and supporting the next generation of infrastructure.

AI-powered developer tools for smart contract auditing, automated testnet deployment, and cross-chain code generation are in development. Liquidity infrastructure featuring AI-optimized MEV protection, cross-chain aggregation, and dynamic fee optimization will unlock new capital efficiency. 

The pattern is clear: We identify infrastructure gaps. We build the solutions. We support the builders who scale them.

<b>If you have an idea that could really make an impact in the AI x Web3 space, we have an ongoing Grant program and are on the lookout for solid teams to work with.</b>

<b>The Flywheel Is Spinning</b>

Every project we support creates demand for the next layer of infrastructure. Every solution we build attracts more builders to the ecosystem. This creates a compounding flywheel: Builders → Infrastructure → Adoption → More Builders.
