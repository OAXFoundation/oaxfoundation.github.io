<br><b>Wrapping Your OAX Token to BEP-20 Guide</b>

Over the last two months we’ve spoken about how the OAX token is now available as a wrapped BEP-20 token so our community can take advantage of trading on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) exchanges as well. For those that are used to trading directly on Binance, we put together a simple outline for you to take advantage of this additional 

We’ve created a simple guide for our OAX community on how to do so. See what stage you are on the flow chart and refer to the step-by-step guides below to help!

<br><b>Creating a Metamask Account</b>

The most important thing to remember about creating your Metamask account is to keep the secret phrase safe!

<br><b>How to link Metamask to the BSC Network</b>

This step is required for BSC exchanges to properly connect to your wallet. Metamask by default upon set up is for the ETH chain so you need to be sure that you add the BSC network. 

Also, if you use Metamask for both ETH and BSC Exchanges, be sure you’re using the right network upon connection otherwise it will not connect properly!

<br> For Step 3, the details of the network can be found on <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain">Binance</a> or <a href="https://chainlist.org/">Chainlist</a>.

<br><b>Creating (Adding) a OAX Token Category to Your Metamask Wallet</b>

Yes, a slightly clunky title, but this step is getting the category of token added to the wallet, not the actual act of transferring tokens from another wallet.

In order to do this step, be sure to make sure you have the correct OAX contract. You can find the OAX contract on <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x701c244b988a513c945973defa05de933b23fe1d">Etherscan</a> (for ERC20 tokens) and <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x31720b2276df3b3b757b55845d17eea184d4fc8f">BSCScan</a> (for BEP20 tokens). We also have our contract links listed at the bottom of our webpage if you are ever in doubt. Always ensure you have the correct contract and don’t get scammed!
