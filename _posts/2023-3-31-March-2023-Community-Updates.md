As we wrap up the first quarter of 2023, the team is excited to see the progress we’ve made over the last three months. 

Having launched the <a href="https://notifs.co/">Notifs DeFi Portfolio Tracker</a> in the beginning of January 2023, the team has been hard at work bringing more features and fine-tuning the user experience. Have you noticed the changes in our latest two updates?

It’s been interesting to watch the larger market this month, with most eyes focused on the US. 

Silicon Valley Bank had a near miss earlier this month as US regulators had to step in and save many of its clients, giving them access to their accounts and guaranteeing all deposits. At the same time, regulators also stepped in to shut down Signature Bank, foreseeing similar challenges between the two banks and taking a more proactive stance. Together with Silvergate Bank that was the first to be affected, the three banks were known within the crypto industry to be favorable options for account openings, especially for an industry that many other traditional banks had not yet embraced.

While the market has largely recuperated from the news, it was a rocky few hours for stablecoins faced with some uncertainty. The larger implications of this also is yet to be seen but in the meantime, we’ve also recapped some of the <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/03/28/Q1-2023-Regulatory-Update.html">Q1 Regulatory Updates</a> that will continue to shape the ecosystem.
