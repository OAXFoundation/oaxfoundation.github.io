Hello OAX Airdrop Participants!

We would like to thank you wholeheartedly for your participation in [the OAX Airdrop that lasted from July 16th 2018 to January 15th 2019](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-airdrop-closed-bfea7351357a). It has been a success thus far, and it would not have been possible without your support!

Those who successfully participated in the OAX Airdrop should have already received our notifications; depending on your participation level, you might have been asked to proceed with the [KYC (Know Your Customer)](https://www.oax.org/en/pages/kyc) information submission.

If you have not yet done so, please submit your KYC information before we can distribute your OAX Airdrop Tokens.
Please kindly:
1. Proceed to the [OAX Airdrop Registration Link](https://www.oax.org/en/airdrop);
2. Enter the same e-mail address that you submitted for the OAX Airdrop participation;

Depending on your level of participation, you might be asked for the following information:
1. Your Name (First, Middle, Last; as shown on your passport or national ID);
2. Gender;
3. Date of Birth (please enter in the format of ddmmyy)
4. Nationality; 
5. A clear scan or photograph of your passport/national ID;
6. A clear photograph of you holding your passport/national ID (please ensure that the information, your headshot on the document, and your face are all clearly shown);
7. A clear scan or photograph of your proof of address showing both your name and address from the past 6 months (this could be a bank statement or a utility bill for electricity, gas, water, mobile phone, landline… etc.);
8. Please ensure that all uploaded documents are either in jpg or pdf format.

In order to ensure a smooth process, we would like to encourage you to submit the above information as soon as possible. If the required information is not submitted, we will not be able to process your registration and you will not be able to participate in the Airdrop.

If you have already done so, please rest assured our team is working on processing all information so we can distribute the OAX Airdrop Token to your registered wallet address at the scheduled period between February 26th — 28th 2019.

If there is any further inquiry or any suggestion, please feel free to reach out to us:[info@OAX.org](info@OAX.org)

Once again, thank you so very much for your participation in the OAX Airdrop and for supporting the vision of an open, transparent, and decentralized ecosystem that allows you to hold your own keys!
