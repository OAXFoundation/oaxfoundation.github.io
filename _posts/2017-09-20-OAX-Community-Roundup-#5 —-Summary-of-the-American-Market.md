A lot of fear and general uncertainty in the market this week with the release of China’s policy. The reality is no one really knows what the real long-term repercussions will be. In addition, there are talks swirling about what the SEC will eventually say about U.S. based token sales. I have personally seen language changes from ICO to token sale or crowd sale. In addition, ICO’s are scrambling to ensure their token or coin is not a security.

A lot of talk about the Enigma ICO. They were hacked, specifically a password was social engineered and sensitive data / material was obtained. In addition, they raised and then lowered their hard cap in one day leaving many people confused and upset. The overall sentiment in the community is growing for more transparency and possible even regulation as some of these projects fail to deliver a secure token sale.

I believe there are a lot of possible partnerships for OAX in the U.S. market. Some projects are in desperate need of a decentralized exchange, and I know there is room to add quality tokens once OAX gets up and running. I do not know the best way to reach out, or if you have a team that will reach out, but opening up some channels of communication might be beneficial down the road.

Finally yet importantly, I like the communication being provided by the team. I know that any update in progress, pictures of the dev team or anything of that nature is always a positive. This is a long-term hold for most people and seeing these communications lets them see that work is happening and you do care about developments in China and around the world.
