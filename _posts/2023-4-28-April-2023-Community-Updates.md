<b>April 2023 Community Update</b>

<br>Hey there OAX community,

Hope you all had a wonderful Easter break! 

It's been a pretty exciting month for the digital assets space with the successful implementation of the Shapella Upgrade on Ethereum, which allowed staking withdrawals. There were concerns that this would lead to a sell-off, but instead, investors remained optimistic about the future of Ethereum. Hong Kong is also making waves by establishing itself as a blockchain hub with clear regulatory guidelines on digital assets. This move is expected to attract blockchain firms to the city, leading to a revival of activities and events in the growing crypto and web3 space.<br><br>

<br>We've been riding this wave of excitement following the Hong Kong Web3 Festival and took the opportunity to organize our very first meet & greet on-ground event with <a href="https://twitter.com/852web3">825Web3</a>, one of Hong Kong's largest web3 communities.<br>

<br>The response was overwhelming, and we had a great time sharing the progress we've made with <a href="https://www.notifs.co">Notifs</a> - the ultimate DeFi portfolio tracking app. We also received plenty of valuable feedback and feature requests from users wanting to take Notifs experience to the next level. 

The Notifs team have been continually working hard on product development and we're excited to be announcing the latest features upgrade in version 1.1.4. One of the key upcoming features to highlight is our referral program, where you can participate by simply sharing a unique code with your friend. 

Overall, it's been an exciting month for the OAX Foundation, and we're committed to growing and improving our platform to better serve our users. Thank you for your continued support, and we can't wait to share more positive news with you soon!
