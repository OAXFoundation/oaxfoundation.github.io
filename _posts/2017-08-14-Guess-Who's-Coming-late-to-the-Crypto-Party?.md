_Crypto- The Love Story of Today_ 

It’s been a pretty wild past few weeks in the world of crypto. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a [report](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings) on July 25, essentially stating that the tokens sold in some ICOs can be considered securities. The report, along with the uncertainty of what would happen on August 1, gave more than a few people cold feet. Two big-time exchanges, Bithumb and BTC-e, were also either [hacked](http://fortune.com/2017/07/05/bitcoin-ethereum-bithumb-hack/) or [shut down](http://fortune.com/2017/07/27/btc-e-digital-currency/). The past few days however, have seen Bitcoin prices reach an all-time high of $3,400 USD, and Ethereum prices reach $300 for the first time since late June. Despite this rollercoaster ride of news, it has not been enough to deter several high-profile people and organizations from getting into crypto.

As with sports fans all around the world, I’ve been looking forward to the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight ever since it was announced. I was following both fighters closely on social media, when I noticed [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXD4KDqgX3x/?utm_source=ig_embed).

Even though it’s not clear how Mayweather is involved with Stox.com, a market prediction platform, its ICO did manage to raise $33 million. It’s never a good idea to get someone who supposedly can’t [read](https://www.theroot.com/can-floyd-mayweather-jr-read-1796905338) and is a convicted [domestic abuser](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2014/11/18/floyd-mayweather-josie-harris-domestic-abuse/19221605/) to promote anything, but his Instagram post does have over 500k likes and will at least bring exposure to the crypto world, possibly to a section of the public who have never heard about Bitcoins before.

Goldman Sachs recently released a crypto-focused report, suggesting clients to keep a closer eye on the market. The report read “Whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are), real dollars are at work here and warrant watching.” Goldman Sachs joins the list of [hedge funds](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedge-funds-tied-to-cryptocurrencies-exploding-over-70-in-pipeline) recently getting involved in crypto.

Over in Japan, a Tokyo-based department store chain, Marui, has been testing Bitcoin payments in one of its locations. This continues the trend of retailers accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment, with German fast food giant Lieferando starting to accept Bitcoins last month. American online retailer Overstock, which has been accepting Bitcoins since 2014, has also [added](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/30939/online-retailer-overstock-starts-accepting-bitcoin-cash-and-ethereum?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=finextrafeed) Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and other altcoins as payment options.

Dmitry Marinichev, a technology security aide to Vladimir Putin, is looking to raise $100 million for the Russian Miner Coin ICO. The benefit for investors is that they will own rights to 18% of the total revenue earned using the company’s mining equipment. Marinichev states that Russia has the potential to take up 30% of the global cryptocurrency mining business in the future. He says that the goal is to overtake China in global mining operations.

The OAX team is all for the promotion and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Despite some bumps in the road, we think the past few weeks have generally been positive with several high-profile people and organizations getting involved. We here at OAX think the mass adoption of crypto will happen sooner or later, and we’d just like to help speed up the process by creating an awesome decentralized platform to accommodate the growing market.
