<br><b>October 2025 Community Updates</b>

<b>Macro Market Shifts</b>

October has been a month filled with uncertainty, from US harsh tariffs to the threat of a government shutdown. Gold saw a massive rally, outperforming Bitcoin in the past few months before a recent pulling back. The market sentiment has shifted dramatically as October comes to a close, we’re seeing some positive outcomes from the meeting between <b>Trump</b> and <b>Xi</b> such as the reduction of tariffs along with various deals to de-escalate tension.

This week, the Fed cut rates by 0.25% even while navigating some unknowns on economic data due to the shutdown. AI and tech stocks got a solid boost, with <b>Nvidia</b> in the spotlight thanks to ongoing demand for its chips from China. We're looking at more market anticipation as earnings reports unfold into November.

<b>Resilience of Crypto</b>

Turning to the digital asset world, despite being faced with a brutal correction this month, institutions are steadily accumulating. <b>ETH</b> has been outpacing <b>BTC</b> lately in DATs accumulation, with <b>SOL</b> not far behind. A key point from <b>a16z</b> research stands out: stablecoin transactions have decoupled from crypto trading volume. This suggests people are choosing to hold stablecoins over fiat, which shows confidence around stables and points towards broader sector growth and development.

<b>Wrapping up</b>

As we close out the month, we're set to end the year on a positive note, with improving macros and active building efforts working together with prospectus projects as we move forward as a foundation. 

In this AI era, projects must carve out their unique edge to deliver real value, blending innovation with purpose to stand out in an increasingly crowded landscape while remaining nimble and agile. 

Crypto, in particular, thrives on experimentation; it's a realm where bold trials and rapid iterations reveal what truly resonates, teaching us that true progress often emerges from the ashes of failed attempts. In the fusion of AI and crypto, let's not just adapt, let's pioneer the future, because the bold don't follow the wave; they create them.

Happy Halloween!
