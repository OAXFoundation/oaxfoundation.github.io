We mentioned in our [June newsletter](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/community-update-june-2019-183efcee3ec1) that, going forward, we will be updating the community more regularly on our projects to build solutions to promote digital asset trading. As such, we kick-started the second half of the year with yet another [blog](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/order-cancellation-in-trustless-setting-68c3470f576e) from our development partner Enuma Technologies.

This latest blog points out the challenges in executing order cancellation in a trustless setting, a highly critical area of the project, and what the team believe are the possible fixes. It then goes on to explain the dispute resolution mechanism and the role smart contracts play in it. All in all, it’s a great follow-up to the previous month’s [entry](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/a-deep-dive-into-technology-5a92c18d8485) on how the technology ensures a high level of security across the platform and [our paper](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/new-paper-new-milestone-74ee6e736d5b) setting out the technical specification of the L2X protocol.

July also saw our team stepping up their effort to engage our partners and the rest of the blockchain community. Just last week, our General Manager Amanda Liu and Technology Director Wayland Chan went to the nearby Chinese city of Chengdu for a talk on the current state of the Polkadot Network. The talk was part of a tour by Dr Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and the architect behind Polkadot, and Dr Alistair Stewart from the Web3 Foundation.

To those of you who’re not familiar with Polkadot, it is one of the most highly anticipated blockchain projects out there. Its goal is to enable interchain operability, or in simpler terms, ways for different blockchains to interact with each other. If you want to know more about this concept and also what our team learned from the speakers at the talks, read our blog about the trip [here](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/parathreads-and-scaling-our-takeaways-from-a-polkadot-meetup-75b28b5a0072).

Earlier in the month, Amanda also attended the Hong Kong leg of RISE, one of the world’s biggest tech and startup conference, at the invitation from our partner Blockpass. Just like years past, the conference featured a large number of insightful discussion as well as networking opportunities.

Last but not least, our team has continued to provide the community with insights to things that are happening in the world of blockchain. We followed the [analysis](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/libra-the-devil-is-in-the-details-c137c996c589) on Facebook’s Libra project in June with a [piece](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/are-you-hacked-off-with-hacking-6536b7b77873) on the US$4.2 million loss to hacking by Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue. News like these serve as a reminder of the importance of moving the industry towards trustlessness — one of the key principles the OAX Foundation tries to uphold.
