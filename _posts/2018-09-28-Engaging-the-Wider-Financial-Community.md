Over the past months OAX Foundation participated in a couple of major events targeting the Hong Kong blockchain community. This week we decided to change things up and focus on promoting the project to the city’s wider financial and professional community. 

Those of you who have been following this channel would remember that, earlier this year, we were invited to an internal HSBC roadshow hosted by its global markets team. It was a good opportunity for us to introduce the OAX platform and the concept of digital assets trading to sales-traders at one of the world’s biggest banks. 

This week our General Counsel Paul Li delivered another speech at a lunch-and-learn session to about 40 members of the Hong Kong Society of Financial Analysts, a local affiliate of the CFA Institute. 

Building on the speeches he previously gave to the Law Society of Hong Kong and at the Finwise Conference, Paul again focused on the regulatory challenges involved in both centralized and decentralized models of digital asset trading.

Joining him at the stage was Ryan Rabaglia, head trader of OSL Ltd., Asia’s biggest digital asset brokerage, who gave the audience a comprehensive introduction to the latest development of the industry. 

Engaging the wider financial community with these talks is a really important way to spread the word about what we’re doing. Educating them about the potential decentralized exchanges have and answering questions will help build confidence in the system.
