<br><b>OAX Foundation Year-End Market Recap and Community Update</b>

As we close out 2025, the market remains volatile with uncertainties around interest rates, digital assets priced dipped from the peak with slow ETF activities, meanwhile gold price continues the rally. With January in sight, historically a strong month, we anticipate the reallocation of capital will move the market again.  

We are reflecting on the strides made toward our core mission. Back in our February <a href="https://www.oax.org/2025/02/10/Shaping-the-Web3-Driven-Future.html">update</a>, we reiterated the OAX Foundation's unwavering focus on driving innovation in the decentralized ecosystem. We're pleased to share meaningful progress, not only within the Foundation but across the broader community. Our influence is extending far beyond our direct initiatives, engaging builders and fostering collaborations for real-world impact.

Despite our longstanding legacy in decentralization, this past year has involved deep listening to our community. AI has emerged as an unstoppable force in technology, and we've embraced its convergence with decentralization. If AI is the new "shovel" powering discovery and efficiency, then decentralization provides the open "road" for accessible, trustless infrastructure. With both fields maturing rapidly, builders now have the tools to create transformative applications and platforms that redefine commerce, finance, and innovation.

2025 was also the year of many amazing events that we’ve had the pleasure to attend, both for the Foundation and alongside the GMAsia team. We are deeply grateful for the opportunities to meet many leaders and projects, and are excited for even better in 2026. 

<b>Spotlight: 2025 Flagship AI Project - GMAsia</b>

One standout example is our support for <b><a href="https://gmasia.ai/">GMAsia</a></b>. At first glance, it appears as a sophisticated event calendar app for crypto and AI gatherings across Asia, featuring flagship conferences in one place such as Consensus HK, Bitcoin Asia 2025 and Web3 Festival. 

But its vision is far grander: positioning Asia as the global gateway for innovation, attracting worldwide tech talent and capital. Events are just the starting point. By leveraging AI, GMAsia aims to become the "crystal ball" of Asian innovation, bridging knowledge gaps, empowering users, builders, and professionals to upskill, and preparing everyone for the next era of commerce in a fast-evolving space.

The team has been hard at work behind the scenes, and have constantly made updates to the user experience of the platform.Throughout its launch less than 2 months ago, the <a href="https://x.com/GMAsiaHQ">GMAsia X Page</a> has amassed over 1,000 followers, which we hope is a sign that all of you are supportive of the team’s efforts. Please join us on this exciting journey. 

<b>Community-Driven Insights</b>

Your voices matter. We're committed to amplifying community feedback to guide our direction on new projects and initiatives. Our recent joint campaign with GMAsia generated tremendous engagement and ideas, this is exactly the collaborative spirit we champion. It helps fellow builders refine roadmaps and highlights the unique strength of the OAX community.

We’ve had quite a few meaningful feedback from you guys on how the GMAsia team should move forward, and we’d like to thank each and everyone of you who left your suggestions! Stay tuned for Winner Announcements coming soon.

We also posted a Community Poll to gauge sentiments on the crypto and Bitcoin space for next year. Despite a rather turbulent year end for the crypto market, it’s good to know that most of you are still feeling quite positive about the direction the space is heading towards in 2026.

<b>Ecosystem Growth & Hackathon Collaboration</b>

To accelerate our momentum, we're combining our expertise in Blockchain, AI and community building with strategic partners. We're scaling efforts alongside leading institutions like HKUST and its student associations to boost AI literacy and develop practical, real-world applications.
We're also excited about formalizing our partnership with <a href="https://hacktheeast.com/">HacktheEast</a, including sponsorship, judging and mentoring for winning teams at their upcoming hackathon.

<b>Closing thoughts</b>

Market volatility has persisted throughout the year, as it always does in this space but it has not distracted us from our core mission of supporting builders, with our unwavering conviction in long-term development keeping us moving forward through peaks and troughs, staying relevant, and making strategic pivots in an ever-accelerating ecosystem. Our focus remains on sustainable growth, where relentless collaboration and hands-on building propel OAX ahead, as demonstrated by our flagship initiatives and expanding partnerships.

The OAX Foundation's journey is just accelerating, more innovations are on the horizon.
