For those that have followed us on our journey over the last year, you will know that we’ve been working to build use-case features that can be applied to the Polkadot Network. It’s been a journey of designing the features, developing the coding and of course a lot of testing. This, and of course, the ongoing dance between the updates that the Polkadot team is doing at the same time.But for those that are perhaps just jumping onto the DeFi wagon now, and looking to learn more about Polkadot, perhaps a recap on our last year will be good.
