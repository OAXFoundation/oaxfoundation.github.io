<b>Community Update – November 2019</b>

November has been a busy month for the industry, with Fintech Weeks happening both in Hong Kong and Singapore. The team monitored the news remotely thanks to our partners, getting updates on the newest announcements and regulations, but rather than running around, we decided to do things a little differently this year.

It’s times like these that our partners serve as an invaluable resource, giving us real-time updates, but more importantly the discussions and insights that come from our conversations. Our take in snapshot can be found <a href="https://www.oax.org/2019/11/15/HK-SG-Fintech-Weeks.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

While we stayed at our home base, a little bit of housekeeping was in order. Having launched a revamp of our website earlier this year, some feedback we’ve gotten from our community was the need for a clear resources page. The work we do sometimes gets spun out onto different platforms, based on what suits the content best, but we understand it can get messy at times. As a result, we’ve consolidated all the links to various aspects of our project onto one <a href="https://www.oax.org/resources/" target="_blank">page</a> as an ongoing directory. Take a look if you haven’t already, perhaps you’ll find something you didn’t know about before!

Our post this month is a bit shorter, we’ll leave the reflecting and forward thinking to next month’s community update. The end of the year is approaching us with blinding speed, and as we’re scrambling to pull together our future plans, we hope to have more updates to share with everyone very, very soon.

In the meantime, if you haven’t gotten enough of us yet, EJInsight has published a <a href="http://www.ejinsight.com/author/wp_13473/" target="_blank">two-part article</a> about the utopian nature of blockchain, and what it really needs to become mainstream. Just a light read for anyone who considered the proposition!
