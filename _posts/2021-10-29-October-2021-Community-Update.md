<br>What a rally the market has seen this last month, and we hope everyone has been trading safely. We have an exciting campaign coming up on Binance, and if you follow us on our social media channels you’ll be seeing hints that we’ve been dropping to our community.

<br>OpenSwap has been releasing some interesting news lately, with information about their <a href="https://medium.com/openswap-dex/openswap-troll-talks-chapter-3-whats-wrong-with-current-bridges-86efd873e170">queues and bridges</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/openswap-dex/key-feature-update-introduction-to-openswap-troll-camp-1e7e29b70fa5">troll camp introduction</a>.  How many of you are looking forward to joining the troll camp to earn the right to be a bridge troll? We think it’s an interesting way to create utility for the NFT and can’t wait for the launch! <br><br>

<br>And last but not least, a big congratulations to Professor Syren Johnstone. After all the work he did with the OAX team to explore crypto regulations resulting in the <a href="https://www.oax.org/resources/">three-part paper</a> we’ve shared in the past, he has gone on to publish a book “Rethinking the Regulation of Cryptoassets: Cryptographic Consensus Technology and the New Prospect”. We love to see how our grants nurture ideas that can grow into bigger things that reach different audiences. Find his book <a href="http://bit.ly/profSyrenbook">here</a>.


Stay tuned for November, we can’t wait for these campaigns to roll out!
