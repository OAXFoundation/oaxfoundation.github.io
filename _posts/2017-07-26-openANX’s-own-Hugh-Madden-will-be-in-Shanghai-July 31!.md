Hugh will be presenting on Day 2 (July 31) of the Finwise Summit. The Summit itself is about the development of fintech in China. More information about the event can be found here.

Besides presenting about openANX, Hugh will also spend two hours having one-on-one meetings with community members and supporters. If you’ve ever wanted to have an audience with the CTO of a major fintech company and pick apart his brain, this event is your chance!

The openANX team will also be giving out free souvenirs at the event. Because we are so eco-friendly, we will be giving out an openANX recycling bag. Limited edition electric fans and towels will also be handed out.

The openANX team won’t be the only ones handing out our souvenirs. We have also hired two beautiful Chinese models, who will be dressed in openANX gear, to hand out souvenirs and take photos with our supporters.

The ticket price for the Finwise event is $2499 RMB, or around $370 USD. To thank our supporters, we will be giving out a few tickets to those who have contributed 10,000 or more OAX tokens and completed their registration on [https://registration.openanx.org/](https://registration.openanx.org/).

Please email [projectstallman@openanx.org](projectstallman@openanx.org) with the amount of OAX you have contributed and your registered email address for a chance to win a free ticket.
