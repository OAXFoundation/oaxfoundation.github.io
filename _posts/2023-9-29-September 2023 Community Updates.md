<br><b>September 2023 Community Updates</b>

Hi OAX community,

We hope you're having a fantastic month! As part of our commitment to keeping you informed, we wanted to recap some of the notable articles we've published this month. We've covered a follow up piece on Layer-2 <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/09/22/Part-2-of-A-New-Wave-of-Layer-2-Solutions.html">solutions</a> and the excitement surrounding <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/09/07/Worldcoin's-Vision-for-a-Decentralized-AI-Powered-Society.html">Worldcoin</a> since its launch. Rest assured, we'll continue to bring you updates on Layer-2 developments, adoption and notable projects being built on these chains in the months ahead.

In other news, we're thrilled to share key <a href="https://notifs.co/blog/notifs-token2049-singapore">learnings</a> from Notifs - the project we proudly support, recently participation in the TOKEN2049 event in Singapore.

We also want to give a huge thank you to everyone who participated in our <a href="https://gleam.io/KZjS2/notifs-x-oax-summer-gleam-campaign-880-usdt-prize-pool">Gleam campaign</a> in the month of September - response has been great and we’re thrilled at the support! As it’s a long weekend for some of you, now’s a good chance to join in on the fun and still be in the running for our prize pool. The campaign will be ending on the 5th of October, so mark the dates and be on the lookout for our winner announcement in the coming weeks.

Looking ahead, we're excited for the upcoming <a href="https://www.fintechweek.hk/">Hong Kong Fintech Week</a> at the end of October. Following our recent visit of Polygon’s founder - Sandeep Nailwal here in Hong Kong, we’re anticipate a vibrant gathering of the Web3 and crypto community here with visits from prominent projects and founders in Q4; Hong Kong’s general <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Hong-Kong-is-serious-about-becoming-a-Web3-hub">support</a> for the Web3 community is indeed a positive sign for the growing ecosystem.

While we’re at it, we’d also like to take this opportunity once again to remind all our community members to stay safe in the digital assets space. Remember to never share your private keys or personal details with anyone, and it’s always best to hold at least a portion of your assets in your own wallet (<i>even better yet, explore <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cold-storage.asp">cold wallet</a> options</i>).

Lastly, we want to wish everyone a happy Mid-Autumn Festival. May your celebrations be filled with joy and togetherness!

That's all for now, but stay tuned for more updates and exciting news.
