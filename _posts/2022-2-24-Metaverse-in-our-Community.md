<b>Metaverse in our Community</b>

The idea of a Metaverse has got so much buzz over the last few months, we were curious what our community thought would be the Metaverse to watch for the future.

So what were our findings based on our social media groups? The competition is hot between the Sandbox, Second Life and Decentraland!

For those who participated in the first round, tell us more about why you chose the platform you did! We don’t expect the Metaverse roadmap to be clear cut– will one rule them all or will we be expecting interconnectivity between the worlds as we hope to see with our exchanges? It remains to be seen if the worlds will become more targeted towards audiences and focus on specialty routes or if they will take a broader generalist approach; likewise we wait to see how businesses will begin to integrate real-life services to the Metaverse realm.
