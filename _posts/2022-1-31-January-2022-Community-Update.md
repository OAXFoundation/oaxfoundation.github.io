<br><b>January 2022 Community Update</b>

And we’ve reached the end of January 2022. The first month of the year continues to be tough for the digital asset market, while large institutional banks and governments have been reporting progress: with the Bank of Korea completing their first phase of their digital currency pilot to Uniswap founder’s account being shut down by JP Morgan Chase. From Thai to German to Russian regulators, changes are being made to push things forward to clarify their stance towards digital assets and meanwhile the IMF has also been urging El Salvador to step back from their stance of accepting Bitcoin as legal tender.
