Here at [OAX Foundation](https://www.oax.org/en), we are thrilled that through the collaboration with [Enuma Technologies](https://enuma.io), [a breakthrough of more than 1,000 TPS](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-reaches-major-technology-milestone-now-its-time-to-partner-up-20aaee18ddcd) in a [testnet environment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSfVCytB5KKuuFOMEGE3rVg/?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Blog+post+link&utm_campaign=190211+OAX+Enuma+AMA) for the OAX platform has been achieved, reaching an important milestone in realizing the vision of establishing an open, transparent, and decentralized exchange ecosystem for cryptocurrencies.

Along with Enuma Technologies, OAX Foundation is hosting an AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) Session on [the OAX Foundation subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenANX).

This AMA will mainly focus on the technology of the OAX platform, but if you have any other question pertaining to our [business development](https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=gf&trkInfo=AQHNHvht3UsCFgAAAWr9j0CoGGIoS-DARgG8ToVKIxdZvVjbgqLv-1iYH6WJ3WuR7vzcXY16JuO2CcNutUeM0ksPCBeA6JbdfLYH5gmH1vnrQt0nUW9GTNp423dJQRCOxf5lbh8=&originalReferer=https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-and-enuma-technologies-to-host-ama-on-reddit-8bafa0dd5b10&sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Foax-foundation%2F) or marketing, please do ask as well!
