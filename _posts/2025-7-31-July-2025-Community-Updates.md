<br><b>July 2025 Community Updates</b>

<b>Crypto Summer: Stablecoins & Institutional Surge</b>

With the total crypto market cap at all-time highs (almost at 4 trillion dollars), Bitcoin near its peak, and Ethereum eyeing $4,000, alt-season buzz is back. However, beware, past hype led to bull traps, although this rally feels different, lenient policies solidifying with the crypto policy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/white-house-crypto-policy-report-calls-sec-action-new-legislation-2025-07-30/">report</a> and institutional buys (ETFs, corporate reserves in BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB) are driving steadier growth. 

Post-Crypto Week, the market was soaring. The GENIUS Act has turbocharged <b>stablecoins and related companies</b>, the narrative has been reflected in stock prices in US and HK markets over the past weeks. Hence, we saw the need for our three-part stablecoins <a href="https://www.oax.org/2025/06/11/Part-One-of-Stablecoins-in-the-2025-Digital-Assets-Ecosystem.html">series</a> to break down the potential, risks, and what’s next for our community.

In Hong Kong, with stablecoin licenses issuance starting August 1, 2025 by <b>HKMA</b>, <b>CEO Eddie Yue</b> mentioned that the requirements are strict and only a handful of companies will pass initially. Requirements include, a corporate status in Hong Kong, having <b>HKD25 million</b> minimum paid up capital, 1 day redemption guarantees and AML/CFT requirements on transaction monitoring and more. We’ll be keeping a close eye on who will be getting the licenses and implications from then on.

<b>AI + Crypto: Empowering Builders</b>

AI is transforming blockchain, and we’re all supportive at OAX, especially the power of vibe coding. Our community loves <b>vibe coding</b>, an AI tool that lets anyone, coder or not, build apps fast. Think Figma (design platform) for coding: web-based, intuitive, and powerful. We’re thrilled that many of you are already testing out this space. Looking forward to seeing more of what you’re building!

<b>AI-Powered DAOs: The Next Frontier</b>

AI and community-run DAOs is another use case that we’re looking into. You’ve told us this combo has huge potential, and we agree. We’re adding AI-driven DAOs to our research roadmap and stay tuned for our upcoming short blogs.

<b>OAX Projects: Bridging Communities</b>

We’re pleased to see many of your AI project submissions. We’ve shortlisted top projects, including one that uses blockchain to connect online and offline communities in Asia. Powered by AI, it speeds up development and delivers insights for events and conferences in the region. More details soon!

If you’re in Hong Kong next month, we will be at <a href="https://asia.b.tc/">Bitcoin Asia</a> to discuss latest agenda of digital assets in the region. Looking forward to seeing some of you there and lets explore collaborations. 

<b>Ethereum’s 10th Year Mark</b>

It’s been 10 years since Ethereum’s first block was created, what started as a 19-year-old college dropout’s idea has grown into the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. 

Back in 2021, in an interview on The Tim Ferriss Show, Buterin described Ethereum as “dynamic and growing… an evolving creature.” That adaptive nature still defines the network today.

While there are still challenges present for the Ethereum blockchain, such as competing blockchains like Solana offering faster transactions and lower fees, nobody can deny Ethereum’s growth and presence in the digital assets space. Its first-mover advantage, large developer community and ongoing updates provide a solid foundation for Ethereum to continue growing - and we can’t wait to see what’s to come for the ecosystem over the next 10 years!

<b>Let’s Keep the Fire Burning</b>

Crypto and AI are converging, and OAX is leading the charge. Dive into our stablecoin <a href="https://www.oax.org/2025/06/11/Part-One-of-Stablecoins-in-the-2025-Digital-Assets-Ecosystem.html">series</a>, share your vibe coding projects, and join the conversation. Together, we’re building a future where everyone can innovate and thrive.
