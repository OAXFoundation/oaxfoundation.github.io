We’re continuing to develop our team by bringing the best people together for each stage of the OAX Project. Following last week’s appointment of Paul Li as general counsel [Here](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/appointment-of-general-counsel-c2d25e9aeb8e), we’re now welcoming Kelvin Wong to the OAX Foundation. He’s taking over from Liam Bussell who guided the marketing of the project during its launch phase and who is now moving on to other activities (though he’ll remain a part of the project team as an adviser).

Kelvin is going to lead the promotion of the OAX project and the OAX Foundation itself through the next phases of development, taking us to new audiences (including at Consensus in May [Here](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018)) and with new ideas. His experience makes him the ideal person to do this, having held regional and global roles in financial services, technology, communications, and journalism.

His nearly twelve-year experience at Bloomberg ranges from being deputy chief of the Hong Kong news bureau, writing reports on the greater China real estate market, to leading sales and marketing campaigns for Bloomberg’s news platform in North Asia. In this last role, he devised and executed sales plans, and spoke regularly at seminars and conferences to promote Bloomberg functionality and content.

Most recently, he worked as global media relations director for a Hong Kong-based holdings and asset management company, where he put in place structures to ensure the firm’s communications strategies were being implemented efficiently and its messages told in a clear and effective way.

This is a pretty unique combination of skills gained in very high profile organisations which will benefit the Foundation across all our marketing and communications activities. With global attention on crypto as intense as ever, we believe we have a chance to make a positive difference to how the industry develops. And with Kelvin on the team, we’re well placed to do it!
