<br><b>May 2025 Community Updates</b>

<b>Bitcoin</b> once again reached an all-time high this year, driving bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Over the past month, the market showed signs of bullishness while investors sentiment remained cautiously optimistic.

Macroeconomic factors contributed to uncertainty, including Trump’s tariff announcements, a Moody’s U.S. credit downgrade, and shifting expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, institutional confidence remained robust, highlighted by <b>MicroStrategy</b>’s purchase of Bitcoin and other companies following suit to add digital currency as their reserve.

Stablecoin regulation in the U.S. is advancing rapidly with the <b>GENIUS</b> and <b>STABLE Acts</b>, fostering integration with traditional finance while addressing risks. The market continues to grow, driven by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, positioning stablecoins as a critical bridge between crypto and global finance. We are excited to cover this in the coming month to take a look at what this means.

<b>On the Ground in Hong Kong</b>

We’ve been participating at key tech events in Hong Kong, Asia’s innovation hub, to stay ahead of the curve on the latest trends shaping digital transformation and user adoption.

The <b>AWS Summit Hong Kong 2025</b>, celebrating its 10th year at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, was a dynamic dive into cloud computing, generative AI, and digital transformation. Regional leaders like <b>HKTV Group, Crypto.com, InvestHK</b> and <b>Octopus Card Ltd</b> fueled discussions on AI’s potential, particularly agentic systems. 

While corporations get to showcase their AI use cases in their workflow, there are plenty of networking platforms among VCs and startups discussing their take on AI applications and impact.

Hong Kong’s startup ecosystem shone brightly, with Nathaniel Chan of <b>BetatronHK</b> emphasizing the city’s accessible capital and robust support from programs like <b>Cyberport</b> and <b>HK Science Park</b>, advising founders to pitch sustainable products over fleeting trends, not incorporating AI for the sake of it, rather the technology should elevate the core business model.

Meanwhile, the <b>Tech Fest Summit 2025</b>, also at the Convention Centre, zeroed in on AI’s dual role as a powerful tool and a cybersecurity risk. With over 50 exhibitors and speakers from <b>PCCW Solutions, HSBC</b> and <b>Crypto.com</b> sharing their way to protect themselves from attacks. 

While AWS was all about what you can create and automate with AI, Tech Fest was about how you can safeguard your operations from all kinds of virtual attacks with the help of AI. As the event discussed the need for scalable cybersecurity to match AI’s rapid evolution, with experts highlighting AI’s transformative role in cyber defenses. 

We are thrilled to celebrate the success of the <b>HK Tech 300 Expo</b>, held on May 23-24, 2025, at <b>City University of Hong Kong</b>. This global start-up competition showcased 300 innovative start-ups across Biotech, AI, Advanced Tech, and Fintech. Attracting talent from nine countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, it partnered with 11 universities and five accelerators. Since 2021, HK Tech 300 has supported over 900 start-ups, with 190 receiving up to HK$1 million in funding, fostering innovation and connecting young entrepreneurs worldwide.

We’re thrilled to be sharing the latest narratives with you in AI, Web3, and broader innovation happening in Hong Kong. As we continue to make meaningful connections on the ground. And this isn’t a one-sided conversation, as we are always engaging with projects who share the same passion with our community.

<b>Community Activities and Highlights</b>
