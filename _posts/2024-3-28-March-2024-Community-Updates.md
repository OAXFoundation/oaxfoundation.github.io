<br><b>March 2024 Community Updates</b>

Hi OAX community,

What an incredibly active week it has been in the crypto market! Despite encountering a couple of corrections throughout this month, we are thrilled to report that we are finishing up near the all-time high region. The market has been brimming with excitement and volatility, and we are excited to share some key updates with you in this community update.

Bitcoin's price has surged past $71,000, showcasing a remarkable 3% gain after briefly dropping to $63,000 over the weekend. Furthermore, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a positive turnaround after facing losses of nearly $1 billion last week, indicating a strong recovery. This surge in price is occurring just ahead of the highly anticipated Bitcoin <a href="https://www.oax.org/2024/02/21/Unraveling-the-Impact-of-Bitcoin-Halving-on-the-Industry.html">halving</a>, scheduled for April 19. As the halving approaches, investors are closely monitoring the market, leading to increased volatility as they speculate on its potential impact.

Following Bitcoin's lead, Ethereum has also displayed positive momentum. However, the SEC has delayed its decision on converting the Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF, extending the timeline until May 30. Industry executives believe that launching Ethereum ETFs in December would attract more assets compared to a May launch, highlighting their strategic considerations.

Memecoins on Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, are gaining significant traction. The market cap of memecoins on Base has grown by 477% to reach $1.02 billion in the past week. Solana memecoins have seen a 17% increase in market cap, reaching $6.4 billion, while the broader Meme category has grown by 12% to $62 billion. Some of the top-performing meme tokens on Base include Briun Armstrung, Jeo Boden, and Doland Tremp. As a result, Base is experiencing a significant uptick this month with record-high weekly transactions and new user signups.
