_“I’m lucky that most of my mentors have been women, and they shared their experiences and guided me along in my career. I believe that in senior roles you have to listen to your staff, to mentor them, so they can mentor others as they progress in their careers.” — Amanda Liu, General Manager of OAX Foundation_

OAX Foundation is honored to have the opportunity to speak on the importance of having women play a part in the growing Fintech space. We at OAX are passionate about creating an impact in the blockchain space and creating more equal opportunities for all.
