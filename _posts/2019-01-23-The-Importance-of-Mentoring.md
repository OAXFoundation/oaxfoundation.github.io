_“I’m lucky that most of my mentors have been women, and they shared their experiences and guided me along in my career. I believe that in senior roles you have to listen to your staff, to mentor them, so they can mentor others as they progress in their careers.” — Amanda Liu, General Manager of OAX Foundation_

OAX Foundation is honored to have the opportunity to speak on the importance of having women play a part in the growing Fintech space. We at OAX are passionate about creating an impact in the blockchain space and creating more equal opportunities for all.

If you joined us at the Women in Fintech panel in IFX Expo, thank you and do come say “Hi” if you see us in the conference!
