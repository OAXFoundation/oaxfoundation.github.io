The Swiss government is investigating several cryptocurrencies that they deemed as fake this week. The investigation was centered on cryptocurriencies that were not actually on distributed networks or any blockchains, but rather stored on company computers. This investigation comes on the heels of China’s policy of order cryptocurrency exchanges to cease all operations.
