<br><b>January 2026 Community Updates</b>

<b>Market Recap</b>

January has been a strong month in the market, driven by key earnings releases amid lingering uncertainty around geopolitical tension and potential US government shutdown. Despite Gold and silver being in the spotlight as safe-haven assets, it made a pullpack at the end of the month. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market has pulled back following Coinbase's withdrawal of support for the CLARITY Act, a move that stalled progress on US crypto market structure reform and contributed to a shift away from risk-on assets.

<b>Consensus: We’ll Be There</b>
