Fresh off the heels of <b>Consensus Hong Kong 2026</b>, the event concluded with an impressive <b>11,000 registered attendees</b> from over <b>122 countries and regions</b>.

<b>Looking Back at Consensus Hong Kong 2025</b>

Last February's inaugural Asia edition made history as the first-ever Consensus event in the region, with Hong Kong selected as the launchpad. 

Key themes from last year continue to resonate strongly today: institutional momentum surged with the shift from "less hoodies, more suits" as TradFi giants like <b>Standard Chartered</b> and <b>Hong Kong Telecom</b> entered the space; regulatory boldness shone through government keynotes and innovations like the world's first tokenized injunction order, which embedded a freezing order on the Tron blockchain for real-world crypto enforcement; and early AI x Web3 convergence laid the foundation with panels on AI agents as future crypto power users. 

Since then, the AI agent space has progressed rapidly, highlighted by <b>x402 protocol</b> launch for instant stablecoin payments and <b>Google's</b> integration into its <b>Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)</b>, transforming early ideas into concrete infrastructure for the agentic economy. These 2025 moments set the stage for the deeper progress seen at Consensus Hong Kong 2026.

<b>Why is Consensus Back in Hong Kong?</b> 

With unmatched connectivity, clear regulations, and robust infrastructure, the city provides the ideal environment for scaling projects in tokenized assets, AI integration, and beyond. We’re excited to be here as a world-class financial center with a builder-friendly approach, Hong Kong has the DNA to propel the Web3 industry forward.

Despite the bearish market conditions persisting into early 2026, the vibrant atmosphere at Consensus HK 2026 demonstrated that the industry is <b>still building relentlessly</b>. Hong Kong's support shines through, backed by high-level endorsements from the <b>Chief Executive and Financial Secretary Paul Chan</b>, who continue to position the city as a global leader in digital assets. 

The <b>HKMA</b> is advancing toward issuing the world's first stablecoin licenses under the <b>Stablecoins Ordinance</b> (effective August 1, 2025), with the initial batch expected in March 2026. This milestone reinforces Hong Kong's position as a leading regulatory sandbox for tokenized assets and real-world applications. 

The city's pro-innovation environment, marked by these ongoing achievements, continues to draw international players for business development, funding, and partnerships. As TradFi and global capital see Hong Kong as the key gateway linking Asian liquidity to worldwide markets. Even with the overall crypto market cap dip, institutions are actively collaborating on foundational technologies to enable broader retail participation.

<b>Spotlight on AI x Web3: The Agentic Future</b>

A pivotal shift is underway: AI agents are now capable of independently interacting with software, accelerating the arrival of an <b>agentic economy</b>. Platforms like <b>OpenClaw</b> remain developer-focused for now, but user-friendly layers are emerging to make them accessible to everyday users. The tech cleverly connects existing tools, promising transformative daily-life applications yet security is paramount.

<b>Community Buzz & Social Spotlight:</b>

We actively covered Consensus 2026 on our social platforms, but we’re not the only ones! We scoured through X to look at different takeaways and highlights from other projects and attendees: in a nutshell, despite bearish outlooks this year, everyone remains positive on Web3 and AI’s long-term trajectory.

The community also highlighted how apart from AI, the spotlight was centered on institutional adoptions, infrastructure, RWA and Stablecoins, which are all set for greater adoption this year as institutions, regulatory bodies and even countries set to embrace more of these technologies.

<b>Our Key Takeaways:</b>

While stablecoins and RWAs provided steady backdrop buzz as highlighted earlier, <b>AI undeniably took the spotlight</b>. Here are the three key themes that resonates with us:

1. <b>AI x Web3 Synergies:</b> AI agents act as powerful catalysts, but rapid growth amplifies security concerns. Cybersecurity, attestation mechanisms, authorization controls, and data/money sovereignty remain critical gaps. Agents can solve UX hurdles, but full user control is still evolving. It's early days, with huge potential ahead.

2. <b>Bridging the AI Knowledge Gap:</b> Indirectly, AI will accelerate Web3 adoption. As part of our mission to drive innovation, we'll prioritize AI education and upskilling for the community, partnering with GMAsiaHQ to help everyone thrive in the AI race.

3. <b>International Influx:</b> A surge of first-time US and global attendees drawn by Asia's market access, funding opportunities, and partnerships. Hong Kong stands out as the ideal spot for TradFi-to-DeFi transitions, offering both sandbox experimentation and real-scale financial deployment.

Consensus HK 2026 reinforced a clear message: despite the bears, <b>the build and deployment continues</b>. Hong Kong's regulatory clarity, institutional momentum, and AI-Web3 convergence make it the place to watch. The OAX foundation is open to collaborations.
