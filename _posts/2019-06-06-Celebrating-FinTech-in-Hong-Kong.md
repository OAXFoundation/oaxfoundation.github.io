Last night the [FinTech Association of Hong Kong](https://ftahk.org/) hosted an event to mark its second anniversary. This is the organization that represents the companies and people making up Hong Kong’s FinTech community, from established global players to local start-up firms like us.

Its aims are to advocate on behalf of the community, to help its members collaborate, and to educate the next generation of FinTech talent. As such, it’s closely aligned to our goals at OAX Foundation which is why some of our leadership team have been busy getting involved in its activities.

[Our General Manager, Amanda]((https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-liu-57934561/)), is a member of the Talent and Diversity committee which is committed to making the FinTech industry representative of the wider community. As many of you will know, Amanda is a [regular speaker](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-supporting-role-models-in-fintech-1c45dabe7a77) on diversity topics and how to build a team that draws from different backgrounds.

Paul Li, General Counsel, is on the Policy & Advocacy and RegTech committees. He’s perfectly at home here given his [public speaking](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/responding-to-the-decentralized-exchange-challenge-2e42c828bf3b) experience on regulatory developments in the digital asset industry, as well as his [background](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/q-a-paul-li-general-counsel-of-hk-based-oax-foundation-on-regulations-and-crypto-exchanges-67c733c38607) working with regulators on investigations at both retail and institutional firms. Also in demand for her expertise is Winnie Mak, our Corporate Finance lead. She’s joined the crypto-assets valuation working group which will be looking at the issues around this important topic for our industry.

Through initiatives like this FTAHK has been going from strength to strength over the last two years. Just on Monday it announced that it was joining forces with the Singapore and Japan FinTech associations to launch the [APAC RegTech Network](https://www.regulationasia.com/hk-singapore-japan-associations-launch-apac-regtech-network/). This new initiative is designed to improve cross-border collaboration on RegTech related issues across the region, and is something we wholeheartedly support.

Last night’s event was a great showcase of how vibrant the Hong Kong FinTech community is, and how well its development is being supported by the Association. We’re looking forward to working together more over the next two years!
