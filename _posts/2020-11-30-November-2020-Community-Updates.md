<b>November 2020 Community Update</b>

We started off the month with the <a href="https://www.oax.org/2020/09/11/OAX-Parachain-Testnet-Released.html">final update to our Testnet</a>, which now includes all the features. Of course since we had the full set of features for our community to test, it was a perfect opportunity to see what everyone had to say. We hosted a small feedback campaign at the beginning of the month and thank you to those that took the time to go through everything with us!

We selected three winners to be given a small “token” of appreciation, congratulations!

We’ve also been making gradual changes to our website, based on the feedback that we’ve gotten from a good portion of our members, and if you haven’t had the chance to see the changes that have been made, be sure to <a href="https://www.oax.org/">check it out</a>. 

The refreshed website also showcases some of the work that has been sponsored by OAX for the larger community. Professor Syren Johnstone followed up on the work that he completed earlier this year with his views on the regulatory circumstances as we near the end of 2020. Read his latest thoughts on how the regulatory environment has changed the digital asset space <a href="https://www.oax.org/2020/11/12/How-Financial-Regulation-Has-Altered-the-Crypto-Asset-Landscape.html">here</a>. 

We’ve always been firm believers of supporting the work that the community does, and enjoy working with parties that share our beliefs. A small spoiler for everyone here, we might have a new community announcement coming your way soon-- we’re terribly excited about the potential of this and can’t wait to share this budding project!
