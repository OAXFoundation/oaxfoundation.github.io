Today Qryptos, the exchange run by Quione [announced](https://www.liquid.com) the listing of OAX.

As the first regulated exchange company in Japan, Quoine is a large player in the market, and we are happy for the recognition for the project.

In other news, the Dev team will all be off to Devcon3 next week to keep up to date with the latest developments in the Ethereum world. Run by the Ethereum Foundation, Devcon is the keystone event of the year for dev tech and developers focused on [Ethereum](https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/).

OAX even played its small part in supporting the Ethereum rocketship! You can see our name WAY down the bottom there. (Ok, we aren’t Microsoft or Status…yet!)

_Right under the ShapeShift Fox!_ 

The guys will be happy to chat and answer any questions around the development and the project, so make sure to say hello. 

##### Working Group

_The Working Group has arrived!_

If that’s not enough, our Working Group will hold it’s first meeting November 8th. We have a great line up of members, from the payments, exchange, KYC, governance and legal spaces. With our aim to make a world class decentralized exchange platform that can integrate with the traditional financial system, it’s key for us to bring together a diverse group, and we will be announcing the attendees soon!

The key aim of the Working Group will be to have a frank, closed door discussion about how to overcome some of the challenges facing the industry, and how to specifically address these challenges in the future development of the OAX Platform. This includes the shaping of best practice, understanding the obstacles to mass adoption and how to overcome them.

For any companies in the above spaces who may be interested in how we are tackling these industry wide challenges, email [workinggroup@oax.org](mailto:workinggroup@oax.org). 

##### Blockchain World Moscow

_What happened to my hairline?_ 

In addition to all that there’s more! I shall be heading to Moscow to talk about the idea that drives the development of the OAX Platform, how it came about, and the challenges we are trying to solve. We have a large, vibrant and vocal community of supporters in the CIS and Ukraine areas and I think it is crucial to keep those guys up to date regarding the project, the thinking behind it and how they can get involved. So, if you are in Moscow on a lonely November eve, come and listen to me.

That’s it for this update, although I would like to also mention that things are moving very rapidly on the development front as well, and I will post a update and perhaps a livestream next week from DevCon3! Stay tuned, things are happening fast!
