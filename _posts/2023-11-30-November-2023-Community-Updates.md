<br><b>November 2023 Community Updates</b>

Greetings, OAX community! 

November has been yet another eventful month for us, with several significant developments and exciting prospects on the horizon. Here's a recap of what's been happening:

The market is abuzz with positive signals of Bitcoin ETF approval, driving increased activity and interest in the cryptocurrency market. We observe encouraging signs of recovery from the bear market, indicating renewed growth and opportunities in the crypto and blockchain space. However, the stepping down of Binance CEO CZ has caused a significant industry debacle. Richard Teng has taken over as Binance CEO as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. It remains uncertain how Teng will manage Binance's business amid U.S. oversight and CZ's departure.

During Hong Kong Fintech Week beginning this month, our comprehensive <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/11/13/The-Hong-Kong-FinTech-Week-2023-Recap.html">coverage</a> focused on the tangible applications of blockchain technology in our everyday lives. We delved into various use cases, examined integration possibilities, and highlighted the increasing momentum towards adoption. A particular area of emphasis was payments, as we conducted an in-depth exploration of <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/11/20/Payments-As-a-New-Driver-of-Crypto-Adoption.html">payment</a> solutions, use cases, and integration opportunities. This deep dive 
garnered substantial attention and interest, underscoring the rising potential for blockchain-based payment systems.

While we periodically send out security reminders throughout the year, we’d definitely like for our community members to continue to practice caution and stay safe. While sentiments are more bullish this year end, there may also be an increase in fraudulent activities and fake Telegram airdrops throughout the space. Remember, our team will never ask you for your private keys or passwords in any case at all.  

Do note the links to our official Telegram groups - <a href="https://t.me/openanxteam">Global English Group</a> and <a href="https://t.me/oax_cn">Chinese Group</a>. We’re strictly not operating any other group and as a recap, here’s our <a href="https://linktr.ee/oax_foundation">LinkTree</a> for a full list of our proper channels. 

Only campaigns launched on the platforms on our LinkTree are hosted or supported by our project - if unsure, reach out to us anytime at all, always best to be safe than sorry!
