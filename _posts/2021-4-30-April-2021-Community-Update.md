<b>April 2021 Community Update</b>

<br>Wow! What a start to Q2 it’s been for us!

We started the beginning of the month by announcing that the OAX token
would be available as a wrapped BEP-20 token. Over the last few months,
we’ve been exploring the opportunities of having our tokens available on
additional exchanges as well, and while exploring the likes of UniSwap
and SushiSwap, we felt that the market conversations of Binance Smart
Chain were compelling enough for us to expand our options as well.

This, of course, was merely to set the scene for the things that would
be happening the rest of the month.<br>

<br>On April 21, we hosted our first joint Telegram AMA with IJS
Technologies, the company we gave the grant to late last year. Thank you
to everyone who joined us and submitted questions beforehand! We had a
little prize for some lucky winners, congratulations to everyone who
won!<br>

<br>We realized that between the different time zones and just being busy
with life means that some of you weren’t able to join us, so make sure
you check out the recap we posted last week. We included some of the Q&A
highlights in our
<a href="https://www.oax.org/2021/04/26/Summary-OAX-IJS-AMA-Recap.html">post</a>.

How many of you prefer the AMA being hosted on Telegram instead of
Reddit like how we’ve done previously? The AMAs are about reaching out
to our community (you!) and we want to know what your preference may be.

<a href="http://openswap.xyz">OpenSwap</a>, the community DeFi platform
that is using the technology that IJS developed, has
<a href="https://openswapdex.medium.com/introducing-openswap-dex-86fb378fbfc5">launched</a>
as well! For those in the community who are interested in seeing how one
grant can grow into something bigger, be sure to take a look. We know
it's only the beginning for the team over there, and we’re excited to
watch its progress as it develops.

Since OpenSwap operates on Binance Smart Chain, and now our OAX token is
BEP-20 ready, as an early thank you for the OAX community supporting the
very beginnings of the technology on this platform, the IJS team will be
including benefits for the OAX token holders in the early stages of it’s
launch. Make sure to join their community to keep up with updates, and
of course we’ll be resharing details on our own platforms as well!

LAST, but definitely not least: we have some very exciting news for
our community! As of today, the
<a href="https://www.openswap.xyz/#/">OAX-BNB trading pair</a> is now
added on OpenSwap. If you haven’t yet had the chance, be sure to check
out their platform!<br>

<br>What we hope to be the first of many; what other pairs are you
looking forward to having? No promises, but as always, a work in
progress. Keep an eye out for news and updates either on OAX platforms
or join the <a href="https://twitter.com/openswapdex">OpenSwap social
media</a> channels as well to keep up to date with our news!
