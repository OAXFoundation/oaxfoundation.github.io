Raphaël joins us from leading French bank BNP Paribas, where he was a member of the Investment Banking team working on transactions across Europe and Asia in technology and digital. Based in Paris, London and Hong Kong, he was involved in landmark mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings and capital raising projects of up to USD10bn for large corporates as well as start-ups.

Raphaël has a master degree in Corporate Finance and Entrepreneurship & Innovation, having studied in France, China and the US. He has been fascinated by Blockchain for years and used to deal with senior leaders across the FinTech industry.

As a result of all this experience, he has the right profile to take an active role in promoting what we do to current and potential partners around the world. His skillset will complement and strengthen the rest of the team at OAX Foundation as it combines management, corporate finance and investment banking at both large, global organizations and smaller, innovative start-ups. You can see from our latest development update that things are progressing well, so it is vital that we have the right combination of skills in place to keep up the momentum on all fronts. Raphaël has already started with us, and we know he will be a great asset to the team.
