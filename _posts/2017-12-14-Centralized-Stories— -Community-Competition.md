Ever had a bad experience with some crypto exchange, a wallet or some other issue with someone holding your private keys? We have:(

On the project, we believe pretty strongly in the future being decentralized, that’s why it’s on our banners.

So, for the Holiday period (If that’s Christmas, the New Year — whenever that falls for you, or some other festival) we are running a competition from now (14th December 2017) to February 16th 2018.

All you have to do is give us a (truthful) story about a time you traded on a centralized exchange and things went badly, or you had a stopped order, or well, anything really. Maybe you had a lot of coins on Mt. Gox, maybe someone reversed your trade and you lost your fortune. Whatever it is, we’d like to hear it, and share it with others. Because we are all in this crazy crypto experiment together.

##### Terms & Conditions
They are pretty simple.
1. Story must be your own experience.
2. Story can be any length but we recommend under 1 page of single spaced text (around 500 words)
3. Story can be shared with us via email at [communitymgmt@oax.org](communitymgmt@oax.org)
Tweeted to us (if its short) [OAX](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation)
4. Posted on the "bounty" channel on the Project Slack 
5. Posted on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/oaxfoundation/photos/a.1570118639693488/1609036342468384/?type=3&theater)

The winners each week will either be selected by us, or by a very strong show of support from the community (Claps, Likes etc)

Each week, the winning-est story will get the author 50 OAX!

The winner at the end of the competition(The 1st OAX World's Best-est Author Story Writer EVER) will win 500 OAX... wait for it... 

Will get a Founding Membership to the OAX Association when it launches in the new year. That's right, on any list of Association members, records etc, this lucky winner will be granted the title of "OAX Founding Association Member".
