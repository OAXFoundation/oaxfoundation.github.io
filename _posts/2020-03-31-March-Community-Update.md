<b>March Community Update</b>

There’s no subject that has taken over conversations in recent days quite like the coronavirus. It’s been tough for the market, difficult for businesses and even worse for those that are fighting the virus or on the frontlines. 

We must do our part to support where we can, even if it means practicing social distancing or simply continuing to do our job (in a responsible manner) – developing for the future. While we’re not yet entirely sure how digital assets might be able to assist in future for a global crisis like this, innovation cannot be dictated. But we hope that advancements can be made wherever and whenever they will be useful in the future.

So, while we’re bunkered down and doing our part to prevent the spread, we figured it would be a good time to reach out to our community—hence our announcement last Friday that we will be hosting an AMA session on Reddit. For 24 hours, April 7-8, we will be accepting questions from around the world about what the OAX team is doing with Polkadot, what our hopes are for DeFi and just some friendly banter along the way. Pay attention to our Twitter page as well, where we’ll be providing highlights throughout the session. 

Feeling excited? Have a list full of questions at the ready? We’ll also be announcing 3 winners after the AMA for best questions asked, so make sure to save the date! And in case any of you need inspiration for that really good question, don’t forget to check out the updated <a href="https://www.oax.org/blog/">News</a> and <a href="https://www.oax.org/resources/">Resources</a> page on our website so you can read our latest articles, and understand more about the OAX Parachain and the key areas we’re focusing on.

Look forward to speaking to everyone soon! In the meantime, stay safe, remain optimistic and be healthy!
