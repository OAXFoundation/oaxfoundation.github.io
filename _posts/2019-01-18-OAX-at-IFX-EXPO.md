IFX EXPO Asia kicks off at the Hong Kong Convention Centre next week and we’re proud to announce that OAX will be part of the event. Our General Manager, Amanda Liu, has been invited by the organizer to speak at a panel titled “Women in Fintech” on Wednesday, Jan 23.

Those of you who have been following our project would remember that Amanda had spoken on the same topic at an [event](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-supporting-role-models-in-fintech-1c45dabe7a77) hosted by DigFin, a leading technology publication, in December, after being featured in their list of the 25 most notable women in Hong Kong FinTech. This time, Amanda will again share her views on talent and diversity, focusing on her transition from banking into fintech and how she built the team at OAX Foundation.

Amanda’s session starts at 4 pm. More information about the event can be found [here](https://www.ifxexpo.com/cyprus2019/).
