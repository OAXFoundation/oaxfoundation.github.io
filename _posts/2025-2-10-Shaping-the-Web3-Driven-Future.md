<br><b>OAX Foundation: Shaping the Web3-Driven Future</b>

<b>GM OAX Community,</b>

The Web3 landscape is evolving faster than ever, and so must we. Against the backdrop of the <b><a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/how-china-can-keep-pace-global-ai-race-2025-01-24/">global AI race</a></b> and rapidly disruptive technologies like <b>DeepSeek</b>, the way the world operates is shifting profoundly. We are already witnessing how AI has become a major catalyst for the development and adoption of blockchain. With that in mind, we’re thrilled to invite you to join us in the next phase of blockchain progression through our new initiative for the OAX Foundation. This is more than just an update; it’s a renewed commitment to driving <b>innovation, fostering adoption, and advancing education</b> within the decentralized realm.

<b>A Vision That Connects Web2 and Web3</b>

Our new initiative's mission is clear: to <b>empower individuals and communities to navigate the Web3 ecosystem confidently</b>. As adoption accelerates and more Web2 users step into this space, we recognize our role in bridging the gap becomes ever so relevant. We are committed to creating an environment where Web3’s promise of decentralization, transparency, and empowerment is not just a concept but a lived experience for everyone.
Whether you're a Web3 pioneer or someone exploring the blockchain space for the first time, the OAX Foundation is here to serve as your guide and ally in your meaningful journey.

<b>Why the NEW Initiative?</b>

We’re at a critical moment:

- <b>Awareness is growing.</b> The potential of blockchain and digital assets is becoming increasingly recognized. Needless to say the high-profile administration and politics leading up to Trump’s inauguration—to corporate moves like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/bitcoin-treasury-pioneer-microstrategy-rebrands-with-a-new-name-strategy.html">Strategy's</a> (formerly MicroStrategy) Bitcoin buying way of business, the momentum is undeniable. The likely inevitable crypto <a href="https://decrypt.co/302711/next-crypto-etfs-dogecoin-xrp-solana-trump">ETF approvals</a> including <b>XRP, Solana, Doge</b> - following Bitcoin and Ethereum would further open the doors for investors, making the asset class more accessible. With a total market cap of $3.5 trillion at its peak, the crypto industry is now on par with tech leaders like Apple, signaling a significant global influence.

- <b>Web3 adoption is scaling.</b> The lines between Web2 and Web3 are continuing to blur, and making this transition seamless is critical. Major corporations like Tesla, PayPal, and Shopify are already accepting cryptocurrencies, leveraging their massive user bases to drive adoption. This trend is extending to traditional giants like AMC, Gucci, and AT&T, further legitimizing crypto as a payment method. Beyond retail and e-commerce, cryptocurrencies play a significant role in cross-border payments, along with more pervasive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/02/06/three-ai-agents-built-on-blockchain-to-transform-crypto-defi-gaming/">AI Agents</a> in our daily lives, much of the existing friction will be eliminated.

- <b>The stakes are higher.</b> As innovation accelerates, so do the risks—making education and research more critical than ever. While tools that simplify access to crypto empower users, they also open the door to <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-phemex-hack-january-2025">vulnerabilities</a> and bad actors. The rise and fall of memecoins has often exposed retail investors to significant risks, many of whom may not fully understand the implications. This is a double-edged sword, reminding us that while we prioritize innovation, we must equally focus on safety and responsible practices.

Amid a landscape often clouded by hype and misinformation, we strive to be a clear, objective, and principled voice, committed to shaping a decentralized future responsibly and thoughtfully. 

This initiative is our response to this pivotal moment. It’s about doubling down on our commitment to help you stay informed, safe, and empowered as we navigate this journey together.

<b>What’s Next?</b>

<b>1. Curated Educational Resources</b>

We’re introducing <b>engaging, accessible content</b> for everyone, from newcomers to seasoned users. Expect:
- Beginner-friendly guides on entering the Web3 ecosystem.
- Deep dives into trending topics like Layer 1 and 2 protocols, AI integration, and decentralized governance.
- Actionable strategies to mitigate risks in the ever-changing digital asset space.

<b>2. Community-Driven Insights</b>

We’re amplifying the voices of <b>you — our community</b>. Your feedback will shape our direction as we explore new projects and initiatives. From reviewing projects to identifying trends, we’ll work together to ensure the Foundation reflects the needs of its users.

<b>3. Ecosystem Growth & Collaboration</b>

We aim to <b>support projects and applications</b> that align with our vision of decentralization and accessibility. Whether you're a developer, creator, or entrepreneur, we want to hear your ideas. Let’s build tools, protocols, and frameworks that benefit the entire community.

<b>4. Influencer & Content Activation</b>

By working with <b>influencers and thought leaders</b>, we will commercialize content that resonates across the spectrum of Web2 and Web3 users. Together, we’ll make blockchain concepts relatable and actionable, driving adoption at all levels.

<b>A Legacy of Evolution</b>

At OAX, we have the opportunity to drive innovation in blockchain technology—with the potential to elevate global systems and unlock incredible value. With this privilege comes a responsibility: to <b>steward this technology with integrity, champion its potential, and guide its adoption</b> in a way that benefits everyone.

Since our inception in 2017, the OAX Foundation has been driven by the conviction that decentralized finance and digital assets would become integral to the future of mainstream finance and commerce. This belief has shaped our journey, fostering collaboration with key players to push the boundaries of blockchain technology.

Through projects like <b>L2X, Parachain, OpenSwap, and Notifs,</b> we’ve consistently embraced change. But our focus extends beyond keeping pace with innovation—it’s about leading the charge. 

With this new initiative, we aim to build on our legacy while defining a new benchmark for what a blockchain foundation can achieve, setting the stage for even greater progress and impact in the years to come.
