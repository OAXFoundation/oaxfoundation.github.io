We’re really pleased to reveal that this year OAX is a three block sponsor of the 2018 Consensus conference! As you’re all no doubt aware, Consensus is the premier blockchain technology summit. Held in New York every year, this time around the organisers are expecting over 4,000 people to attend from more than 70 countries. We chose to sponsor it because of the great profile this will give to the project.

The conference will run over three days from May 14–16, and we’re already in the midst of planning how to make the most of our sponsorship.

The OAX team attended last year’s conference and we can all testify to the value it brings. Having startups, investors, financial institutions, tech leaders and policy makers all in one place talking digital currencies is a huge opportunity for us and we’re really excited to be there again.

Last year we had a busy time meeting old and new contacts, discussing the OAX project and talking to potential partners, backers and future users. We got valuable input from the wider community on all aspects of the project, and are expecting this year to be even more productive. Having three block sponsorship really strengthens our ability to meet people and promote the project.

In fact, it was at last year’s Consensus that we announced the launch of the OAX project. So much has happened since then that we know we’ll have plenty to talk about at the 2018 event. Hope to see you there!
