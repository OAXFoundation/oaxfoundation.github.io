The openANX platform will take advantage of technical developments on the Ethereum blockchain such as payment channels (Raiden[1](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/the-platform-7cce96a3d075#_ftn1), 0x, Swap, ERC20[2](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/the-platform-7cce96a3d075#_ftn2)) and utilize them to overcome the challenges facing the current Centralized Exchange Model (CEM). It will co-opt the strengths of the existing model to improve the existent decentralized exchange attempts by linking existing exchange platforms (as asset gateways) to the infrastructure network and enforcing a collateralized deposit system that will provide users with a way to measure risk.

In addition, by being open source, the project will be transparent and subject to scrutiny and input from users and the wider community. In lieu of a centralized authority (government or regulator) the only way to enforce transparency is to write it into the blockchain itself.

By utilizing the latest technological advances and a peer-reviewed and implemented open source code, the platform will integrate the strengths of the existing CEM model with the best functionality and feature of the decentralized model while circumventing the shortcomings of both systems.

The initiative will offer secondary markets (exchange services) for all forms of Ethereum tokens. Ethereum tokens can be in the form of native Ethereum assets (such as tokens for other DAO), or tokenized representations of off-blockchain assets. User’s will be able to create an order book and list their asset for trading in the openANX decentralized exchange, for a token fee by purchasing a membership. All off-chain services to the DAO will be supplied from competing suppliers.
