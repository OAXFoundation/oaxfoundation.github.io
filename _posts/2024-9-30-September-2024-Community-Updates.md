<br><b>September 2024 Communmity Updates</b>

<b>Macro Catalysts</b>

This month has been packed with significant developments in the crypto space that could reshape the market. Following the Fed's rate cut by half a point, the S&P 500 and Dow surged to 23-year highs, with tech shares continuing to gain optimism. China's aggressive stimulus measures have moved the stock market and are set to inject liquidity into global markets; however, we have yet to see the implications this will have on digital assets.

The Bitcoin ETF market is sizzling, with net inflows of $494.4 million just last week. This brings the week's total inflows to over $1.1 billion, highlighting the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin has surged to an impressive $66,000, marking its best September performance in history.

<b>Sector Spotlight Analysis</b>

Speaking of Bitcoin, we recently published a follow-up <a href="https://www.oax.org/2024/09/13/An-Overview-of-the-Atomicals-Protocol.html">write-up</a> on Atomicals - ARC20, and the response has been nothing short of overwhelming! While this isn’t our first rodeo discussing building on Bitcoin, it’s genuinely exciting to see how this digital asset continues to pave the way for innovative developments in the space.

On another note, stablecoins have been quite the hot topic lately, raising important conversations about both opportunities and challenges for adoption. If you haven’t checked it out yet, be sure to read our latest <a href="https://www.oax.org/2024/09/24/The-Rise-of-Stablecoins-and-Payments.html">research</a> recap. It delves into why stablecoins have become such a cornerstone for the digital asset industry. We’ve also launched a <a href="https://x.com/oax_foundation/status/1838916500994011215?s=46">Community Poll</a> recently on most popular stablecoins, so head on over to take a peek at the results!
