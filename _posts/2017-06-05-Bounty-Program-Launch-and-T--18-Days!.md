The weekend was incredibly busy and rewarding for us, with a lot of interest in the Project across social media.

This was further compounded by the launch of our bounty program over at [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1943946.80);or you can find the Bounty Program discussed in detail [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1947373).

We’ve had emails, calls and messages pouring in over the weekend from people interested in knowing more, getting behind the project, or even wanting to help. We’ve also opened and are running a few thousand people in groups over on WeChat. It’s an exciting time.

Over the weekend we also sat down with Chandler Guo, a member of the openANX team who is well known in China. We shot some videos, which was made extra difficult by the ever present construction that goes on in Hong Kong, and the fact that Guo 大哥 is a busy, busy man!

This week we will be launching a number of new languages for the white paper, shooting some videos outlining some aspects of the project in English and Chinese and getting ready for our trip to Chengdu next week, as well as speaking to the media about the project.

We’ll also be getting some SWAG ready, so look out for t-shirts and stickers!

Full steam ahead...
