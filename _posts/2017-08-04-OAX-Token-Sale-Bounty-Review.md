Since we are close to finalizing a few hiccups in the bounty program, we thought we should give a recap to the success of the campaigns. In total, we had just over 1000 participants, with a majority coming from the twitter campaign. Given the short time frame of the campaigns, I am very impressed by the results. It seems like the community also appreciates our work, and quick payment.

Here are some special mentions from the blog campaign:

We did have a few problems, especially with the blog/media campaign. However, the bounty pool for that will be repurposed into a future campaign. Make sure you keep an eye on the bitcointalk threads!
