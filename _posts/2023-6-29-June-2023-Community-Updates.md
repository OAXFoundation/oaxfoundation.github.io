<br><b>June 2023 Community Updates</b>

Hi OAX community,

With the month drawing to a close, it is encouraging to see digital assets gaining wider acceptance from traditional asset management. The recent news of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filing an application with the SEC for a <a href="https://decrypt.co/146060/this-week-in-coins-bitcoin-and-ethereum-rally-hard-post-black-rock">Bitcoin Spot ETF</a> is a significant development for the digital asset space. This move has sparked a wave of fresh ETF applications from other US asset managers, such as WisdomTree, Invesco, and Valkyrie Asset Management. As a result, Bitcoin has surged in value, crossing the $30,000 mark for the first time since May. We are thrilled about this trend and its potential to push the industry forward. Don't forget that you can stay updated on price movements by setting custom alerts in the <a href="https://notifs.co/">Notifs</a> app.

Following the <a href="https://www.oax.org/2023/06/15/Turbocharging-Decentralized-Experiences-through-Artificial-Intelligence.html">AI</a> wave, ZK (zero-knowledge) has been one of the hot topics, such as Polygon's recent proposal to integrate zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology into its proof-of-stake sidechain network, <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/234354/polygon-2-zk">Polygon POS</a>, is a significant move towards improving blockchain infrastructure. 

In line with this development, the OAX Foundation had the honor of moderating a thought-provoking discussion on the potential use cases of ZK technology and machine learning for the digital asset space. The event featured participants from prominent organizations in the ecosystem, including researcher from Ethereum Foundation and Hong Kong’s politician in Technology and Innovation - Mr. Duncan Chiu. Together with co-host AWS (Amazon Web Services), we explored the opportunities for startups and highlighted the growing interest and adoption of ZK technology in the blockchain industry.

At Notifs, the team has witnessed an overwhelming response in the first-ever <a href="https://notifs.co/blog/notifs-ama-campaign">AMA session</a>. We’re ecstatic to see such interest in our development roadmap and features suggestions that’s already in our pipeline! At the same time, the team is thrilled to bring light mode feature to life in the latest update - <a href="https://notifs.co/blog/notifs-ama-campaign">version 1.1.9</a>, this has demonstrated the teams’ commitment to listening to the voice of the community as we strive to deliver the best user experience possible.
