<b>October Community Update</b>

Happy Halloween! Unfortunately trick or treating this year won’t quite be the same, but we’re finding our own way to pass out treats. 

Community members took part in our little pop quiz last week based on our five feature highlight video, and a lucky 10 winners were chosen to receive USD 50 worth in tokens! Think you can answer all the questions correctly? Only if you watched our demo videos! We’ve posted our pop quiz at the end of this update, let’s see how you do. But let’s give a round of applause to our winners who managed to avoid the tricks and win the prize!

While we’ve released all the demo videos for the full five features, we’ve also been rolling out the same features for the community to test out on our testnet. To date we’ve done three updates, meaning users can now test out Burn, PRC 20, Atomic Swap and our latest, MultiTransfer. If you missed out on our quiz, be sure to keep an eye out for our final update with the Fee Delegation feature on the testnet. Nothing guaranteed, but you might be able to earn some treats too!

The DeFi space has been going on a little bit of a rollercoaster the last two months, with highs and lows. Does that mean it's the end of DeFi? The short answer? We don’t think so! What are the changes that are happening and what does it actually mean? We have an article coming your way that reflects on the status of the industry right now, so be sure to have a read when we post it and as always, we’ll love to hear your thoughts as well on any of our social media platforms.

We have two months left in 2020 and what a year it’s been. But before the year is up, we’re hoping to share some of the things that we’ve been cooking in the kitchen, so keep an eye out for some of the changes that might be coming your way.
