<br><b>March 2025 Community Updates</b>

GM fam,

Crypto market cap ate a punch in March — <b>$3.6T down to $2.8T</b>, turbulence hitting hard. Tariffs got axed, China’s AI boom stole the show, and capital’s moving away from risky assets like crypto. Stock market correlation’s tightening the screws, but <b>Strategy’s</b> still stacking — over 500k BTC locked in. And <b>GameStop</b>? Added $1.3B on Bitcoin. Corporate adoption’s alive and kicking.

Things got real with <b>Bybit — $1.46B hacked</b>, biggest ever. Security vibes? Rattled. Memecoin fever broke too—trading volume tanked $106B, <b>Solana</b>’s bleeding $485M in outflows as the hype fizzled. Flip side? Trump’s pro-crypto wave’s still humming — SEC backing off <b>Kraken</b> and <b>Yuga Labs</b> is a big win, and <b>stablecoins flexed to a $220B all time high</b>. 

Market’s on pause, sniffing for the next spark. ETF approvals? Macro juice? We’re yet to find out. Bitcoin’s hovering at mid-$80K — sentiment’s screaming consolidation, but that breakout’s lurking. 

<b>Events & Supporting Partner</b>

We’re hyped to have a supporting partner at the <a href="https://x.com/OAX_Foundation/status/1905448955535896800">Wiki Finance Expo</a> Hong Kong 2025. Justin Sun flexes <b>Tron</b>’s gig as TradFi plumbing while he’s advising World Liberty Finance and teaming up with <b>TRM Labs</b> and <b>Tether</b> to smack down financial crime.

Then you’ve got Chinese pioneers grinding out projects for digital assets. The floor was buzzing — AI trading certainly stole the show with <b>DeepSeek</b> and <b>Manus</b> dishing real-time market heat and auto-strats. It’s only been a small glimpse of the full potential of what these AI tools can do, and we’re super stoked! 

Cross-border payment and smart contracts for enterprise? We’re excited to vibe with early-stage projects building to bridge TradFi and DeFi — after all, trust’s the name of the game.

Why do we hit these? Straight-from-the-source alpha—industry moves, real builders, unfiltered. As a Foundation, we’re part of the startup hustle — Wiki Expo’s a front-row seat to homegrown gems and the China fintech ecosystem pulse.

<b>Brewing partnerships</b>

We caught some side quests too—linked up with <a href="https://www.oax.org/2024/09/13/An-Overview-of-the-Atomicals-Protocol.html">Atomicals Protocol</a> community leads. Following our previous analysis on <b>ARC-20</b> and your overwhelming interest, we’re going deeper on this exploration. Something is cooking but we can’t spill yet. 

<b>More AI x Crypto use case</b>

One of the sessions, “<b>Transforming Global Finance: AI-Driven Trading</b>” - there was a discussion on Algo’s blending AI with education—teaching traders and students to flex AI for TA. Synergises with <a href="https://www.notifs.co/">Notifs App</a>’s vibes—same goal: leveraging AI for actionable insights, no fluff. Stripping out complexity is one thing, making you an expert is the next level. 

<b>Stablecoins are primed for a positive growth</b>

<b>Stablecoins</b>? Primed to moon. Devere Bryan from <b>First Digital</b> called ‘em the “<b>Super App of crypto</b>”—spot on. 2025’s looking optimistic—businesses and institutions jumping in, regs like <b>MiCA</b> clearing the fog, and TradFi eating it up. Fast, cheap, cross-border wins—stablecoins are that glue. We’ve seen the chatter everywhere, from Consensus to WikiExpo. Stick with us for the big updates.
