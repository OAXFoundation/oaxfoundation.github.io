In order for your OAX tokens to be transferable on or around the 29th, you MUST complete your registration by TUESDAY of this week. If you complete your registration after Tuesday, your tokens will only be transferable sometime AFTER the 29th.

For most contributors, providing an email address and an ETH address will be sufficient for registration. Please watch the video below for instructions on how to register your email address and ETH address.

If we require more documentation, we will email you personally. Please take note that it takes time for us to go through every registration and email those who need to provide extra documentation. In order for this process to go as quickly as possible, please register as soon as you can.

If you are busy and cannot register by the 25th, don’t panic! Your tokens will be safe, and we’ll make them transferable in our next round of activation. However, we would like to see all of our contributors have transferable tokens as soon as possible. Please help us make this a reality.

For a more detailed explanation on how to register, please go to [https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_User_Guide-OAX_Token_Activation_ENU.pdf](https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_User_Guide-OAX_Token_Activation_ENU.pdf).
