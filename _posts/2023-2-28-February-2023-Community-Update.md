<br><b>February 2023 Community Update</b>

What a nice way to start 2023– the space has been alive with the hopes of Hong Kong’s revival of being a crypto-friendly city echoing the sentiments shared during last Fintech Week. As Covid restrictions finally ease up and the city begins to open up again for global business, we remain optimistic that the changes will provide a strong motivator for digital asset companies in Hong Kong.

As many of you know, we launched our Notifs app on Google Play and Apple iTunes early January. A big thank you to everyone who has downloaded and tried our app! It’s very much a work in progress, and we’re in the process of developing the next round of updates.

While daily conversations in our social media channels allow us to see what everyone's thinking, polls often give us insights that we otherwise would miss in a larger snapshot.

In the poll we hosted at the end of the month as part of our Notifs campaign, the community responded with their feedback on the Notifs app and it also shaped the way we’re working on the direction of the app!<br><br>

<br>The team is chuffed that the feature of creating your own portfolio won by such a large margin (after all it’s the very basis of what a portfolio tracker should do). While we initially planned to focus on bringing in some new features to the application, like currency conversion rates, we decided to reprioritize after seeing the initial feedback that came in, with ‘ease of use’ considerably lower than what we hoped. <br><br>

<br>We’ve written previously about how important <a href="https://www.oax.org/2022/11/24/Creating-Tipping-Points.html">good user interface and experiences</a> must be to the successful adoption of the digital asset industry and so we’ve gone back to the drawing board to make adjustments to the app that we’re hoping will offer a more seamless experience of tracking your assets. Afterall, the importance of a strong foundation of usability is vital before we build up to more features and uses.

These updates will be coming to users in the next few weeks before we resume the focus on some additional features so stay tuned to our social media channels and updates! And as always, we’re listening to what you guys have to say so don’t forget to download the Notfis app on Google Play Store or Apple iTunes and let us know how you think we can improve. 

On a side note, results from our Gleam launch campaign with Notifs last month were pretty positive, with close to 11,500 tasks completed and over 2,800 participants who joined in on the fun! We’re glad to have such strong support from our community and we’re also excited to launch more community activities alongside Notifs - do stay tuned and watch this space.

We’ll be hosting another Gleam campaign this week, so make sure you keep an eye out for the details of the new campaign! Join our Notifs community as we’re shaping the app from the ground up and weigh in on your thoughts. We want to get as much feedback during this development process as possible, so become one of our early contributors to shape the future of Notifs!
