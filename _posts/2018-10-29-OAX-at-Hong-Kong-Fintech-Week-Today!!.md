Hong Kong FinTech Week kicks off today and as mentioned in an earlier post we’ll be at one of the first events (Click [here](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/fb/reg/fintech.php) for event details). Wayland Chan, our Technology Director, and Lio Lunesu, from our tech partners Enuma, have been invited by Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) to be part of the events they’re organising this afternoon.

Wayland will be talking about decentralized exchanges, introducing some of the concepts and technology that differentiate them from traditional centralized model. He’ll focus specifically on atomic swaps — one of the buildings blocks of decentralized exchange tradings.

Lio will be looking at a critical topic for our industry — smart contract security on the blockchain network. Security is a prime concern for anyone trading and it’s a particular focus in our industry. Lio will discuss with his fellow panelists formal verification process required for flawless smart contract, and how exchanges can avoid being hacked.

Better understanding of these topics is really important for the industry to progress and mature,and we’re committed to engaging with the community in as many ways as possible to help with this. Monday’s sessions are just one part of a whole programme of activities we’re engaging in to promote our project and the wider digital asset industry. These range from the series of papers by Professor Syren Johnstone on crypto regulation that we’re sponsoring right through to the talk our head of marketing, Kelvin, gave at City U last week. It’s a fast moving industry and we want to help people keep up with and make sense of it.

Wayland’s session starts at 415 pm and will be followed immediately by the panel.
