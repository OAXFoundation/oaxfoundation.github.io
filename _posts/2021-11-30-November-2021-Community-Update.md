<b>November 2021 Community Update</b>

<br>We celebrated the end of October with where it all began: 13 years ago Satoshi released the Bitcoin whitepaper, at which point the doors opened to an unprecedented shift in the financial industry. Fast forward 13 years later, and it's clear that the whitepaper has also changed the societal fabric of what we see in this space today. 

The last month has seen a continuation of NFT rise with Kpop singers also joining the bandwagon, but a meteoric jump in the conversation surrounding metaverses, with Sandbox raising $93M earmarked for expansion.

We wrote an article just last week exploring the metaverse conversations happening around the space, and the very many considerations we’ll need to contend with to make it a success. Check out the article <a href="https://www.oax.org/2021/11/25/Exploring-The-Future-of-the-Metaverse.html">here</a> and let us know what you envision the metaverse future to look like!<br><br>

<br>A very big thank you for our community that participated in the Binance Buy and Swap campaign and we hope you enjoyed the little top up campaign we did on Gleam! 

Rewards for the Binance campaign will be allocated to recipients’ Binance Wallets within weeks after promotion ends and the winning users will be able to see their rewards by selecting Account > Wallet > Distribution on the Binance platform.

The Binance campaign required users to buy OAX tokens and stake the equivalent amount every day during the campaign period. For the new users to Binance and OAX staking, there was a “welcome gift” of sorts as well! We understand from some of the community feedback that the campaign mechanics were a bit difficult to follow through on a daily basis and we’ve taken all the feedback into account for our future campaigns. 

Thanks to the very enthusiastic participation of our staking campaign, the 90-day staking option was already sold out so we also launched a side campaign for our community on Gleam. Congratulations to the winners of our first Gleam campaign!<br><br>
