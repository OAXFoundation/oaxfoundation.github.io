In addition, [Will Warren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-warren-92aab62b/) and [Amir Bandeali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abandeali1/) from the **0xproject** (zero-x project) were in Hong Kong to talk to [Hugh Madden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hughmadden/?ppe=1) and [Dave Chapman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davejchapman/) from the openANX team and are now onboard as an engineering partner! Welcome to the openANX family guys! The **0xproject** are extremely well known in the space since the launch of their white paper about their protocol for low friction P2P trading of ERC20 tokens.

**As the token space continues to develop, the need to exchange these assets will be compounded. 0x protocol will act as a critical piece of infrastructure for the token economy, allowing Ethereum smart contracts to programmatically and seamlessly exchange Ethereum-based assets.**


We sat down with the guys and talked about the crypto-space, exchanges and their thoughts. It was awesome! You can check out [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2PboMAJwcI) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxN0Rh8L_Y8) of the video.

##### T — 10 Until Launch!
The big day is getting closer! This week we will be launching the technical white paper on Wednesday 14 June, and will be doing so via our Slack channel first! Don’t forget to sign up to get an early look!
