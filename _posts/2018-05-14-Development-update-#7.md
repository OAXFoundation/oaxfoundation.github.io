A couple of weeks back we gave you a first look at the user interface. Now we’re proud to announce that a demo of the prototype is ready. This is a big milestone as it really shows how everything is coming together. Not only does it mean that we can really start to publicise the project, it also means that we’re close to launching the prototype itself. We have got more days of testing and stabilising still to do, of course, as with every project of this nature. But for the first time we’re able to give potential partners, users, and — of course — our supporters a proper look at what we’ve been doing over the past year.

This isn’t just a diagram in a technical paper any more, it’s a functioning platform (even if only in demo mode right now). What’s more, the demo version has been produced just in time for Consensus in New York next week. If you’re going to be there, we’d love to show it to you — drop us a line at [communitymgmt@oax.org](mailto:communitymgmt@oax.org) or [info@oax.org](mailto:info@oax.org) to book a meeting.
