The decentralized exchange concept is getting better known!

Our team recently spoke to journalists at global financial media Bloomberg and were quoted in an article explaining the concept to the general audience.

Also this week, industry news site CoinDesk published a story looking at the potential and, in particular, examining how liquidity is a real challenge for current decentralized exchanges — and how achieving it is critical to their lasting success.

Creating and maintaining adequate liquidity is one of the central parts of the OAX project — it’s a key part of our plan to combine the best aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges. In fact, one of the technologies we’re using, 0x, was profiled in the report. It’s great to see the issues that we’re addressing with the OAX project profiled like this — just in the run up to us releasing our prototype.

People are really starting to pay attention to our corner of the digital asset industry and we’re looking forward to sharing more of our work in the coming months!
