The OAX team will be in Korea this Friday to present at the Seoul Ethereum Meetup. Hugh Madden, Technology Director at the Open ANX Foundation, will present the OAX platform to an audience of 200. Ken Lo from the Leadership Team and Liam Bussell from the Marketing Team will also be attending to answer questions from the audience and interact with supporters.

The upcoming Meetup is focused on decentralized exchanges. The idea for the event came up mainly due to the recent hackings of centralized exchanges in Korea (Yapizon and Bithumb). Michael Oved from Swap and Loi Luu from KyberNetwork will also be at the event to present their respective projects. To give a short introduction about their projects, Swap is a peer-to-peer, decentralized ERC20 token trading ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain. You can read more about them [here](https://swap.tech/). KyberNetwork is a new system that provides rich payment APIs and a contract wallet that allows anyone to receive payments from any token, which you can read more about [here](https://kyber.network/).

Everyone here at OAX strongly believes in a decentralized future, and we’re very supportive of other decentralized projects. We hope this Meetup will lead to increased support in Korea for the OAX project, and for a decentralized future in general.

We have plans for more meetups and events all around the world. Our main goals in going to these events is to inform people about the OAX project, gain supporters, and consolidate our community base.

As you may have heard, [Hugh will be in London in September to speak at the World Blockchain Forum](https://twitter.com/OAX_Foundation/status/897761925060100096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E897761925060100096&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fmedia%2F1db493142170fe94fd10e992b4b971fd%3FpostId%3D16f1fd1c61fc).

[Ken Lo is currently in San Francisco talking about the OAX project.](https://twitter.com/OAX_Foundation/status/899874562778685440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E899874562778685440&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fmedia%2Fc2e098ec9289288590a929f9f81edf7b%3FpostId%3D16f1fd1c61fc)

It would be great to see some of our supporters at upcoming events. Unfortunately, for the upcoming event in Seoul, seat reservations are already full. We do however, have many more events planned in the future, possibly again in Korea, so please don’t worry if you feel like you’ve missed out. As always, please follow our social media channels for updates on upcoming events.
