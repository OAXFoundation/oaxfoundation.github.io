Following the recent successful launch of our platform prototype, we at OAX Foundation are pleased to bring you more exciting news today. Firstly, we are airdropping 5,000,000 OAX Tokens to reward token holders for their commitment to the project. Secondly, there will be no token sale this year as OAX has sufficient financial resources to fund its current development program.

##### When is the Airdrop? 

Between July 16, 2018 and Jan 15, 2019.

The airdrop will be allocated based on the level of token holdings utilizing a formula to be published shortly and which encourages commitment to the project.

We will announce the specific details and conditions very soon. Please keep following us through the [website](https://www.oax.org/en) and social media channels.

##### What Else is Happening? 

While we’re not planning any token sale this year, there are many other exciting developments surrounding the OAX project. Over the next few months, we will announce more strategic partnerships and new projects to position ourselves for the platform’s going fully-live next year.

Prior to the prototype launch, in May we [announced](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-and-enuma-technologies-strengthen-cooperation-ea337abe18a7) the strengthening of our relationship with the Ethereum Foundation Grant-winning Enuma Technologies, who is leading the development of the OAX platform.

So what is the team focusing on after the prototype launch? For the project’s second phase, our development team will be busy deploying [SPRITES](https://blog.enuma.io/update/2018/05/24/sprites-state-channels.html), a new blockchain technology that will create a decentralized solution combining industry-leading speed, high transaction volume and lower cost.

We are confident that this new technology, together with our decentralized, shared order books, will help to elevate the OAX Platform to the next level, realizing the full potential and value of the project thereby maximizing the liquidity of the ecosystem.
