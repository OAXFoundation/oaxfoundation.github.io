Last week the openANX team was in NYC to announce the launch of the project at Consensus 2017, and to attend Token Summit, two great events that were hugely important to not only us, but the wider community as a whole. We saw a great number of announcements (including our own) and were gratified to see that much of the crypto and blockchain communities were in agreement with us regarding the move toward decentralization. It seems that more and more people agree in the path forward.

We had a very busy week, meeting people, discussing the project and talking to potential partners, backers, and future users. We gathered valuable input from the wider community about decentralization, the exchange landscape, and feedback on our project. We also started to peer review process for our technical white paper, and launched both our project white paper, (download it [here](https://www.openanx.org/assets/openANX_White_Paper_ENU_V2.0.pdf)) 

and, our subreddit: check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenANX/)

This week will be no less busy. We will be launching the white paper in multiple languages, starting with Chinese. We will also be posting a few short videos featuring the projects CTO, Hugh Madden, discussing various aspects of the market structure and the project itself. Weâ€™ll be providing more information on our bounty program for those who are interested, and bringing on a number of new advisors and backers.

This week we will also be working hard to provide more details to the Russian and Korean communities about the project and how they can get involved. We will also be sending out a update with some surprise details to our subscribers, so sign up to our mailing list at [www.openanx.org](www.openanx.org).
