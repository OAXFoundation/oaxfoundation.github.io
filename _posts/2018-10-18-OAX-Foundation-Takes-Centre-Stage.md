Arguably the two hottest topics in cryptocurrency right now are technology innovations and regulatory developments, and we’re excited to announce today that OAX Foundation is participating in two major events relating to both.

First off, we have been invited to join Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) on stage at one of the opening events of Hong Kong FinTech Week. This is one of Asia’s premier FinTech events, with government ministers, leading entrepreneurs and technologists all discussing the future of FinTech over a week’s worth of panels, demos, and networking. PolyU is co-organising a day of sessions looking at the latest FinTech innovations. It’s a real honour to be a part of this — testament both to the strength of our project and the high regard in which it’s held.

We’ll be presenting on the decentralized exchange model, looking at how it differs from traditional centralized exchanges and how the OAX project plans to overcome the challenges it poses. We’ll also be taking a closer look at smart contract security and how to help prevent exchanges being hacked. These topics are central to the successful evolution of the digital asset industry, and talking about them on stage with PolyU at Hong Kong FinTech Week really demonstrates how we’ve come to be recognised as experts.

The second exciting piece of news comes from the regulatory sphere. Professor Syren Johnstone, from the Department of Law at the University of Hong Kong and the Asian Institute of International Financial Law, is one of the leading experts in the legal and regulatory field in Hong Kong. He’s published a detailed paper on cryptocurrency regulations supported by OAX Foundation. As you all know, we’re committed to bringing the highest standards of transparency and governance to the digital asset industry. This paper is another example of how we want to encourage debate about the right future shape of regulation for our industry.

It’s a wide-ranging discussion of how developing technologies like blockchain intersect with the development of regulatory oversight. It covers issues such as the challenges regulators face in characterizing digital assets and the difficulty of applying a traditional approach to regulatory oversight. It also looks at some regulatory policymaking considerations. This paper is the first in a three-part series, and looks set to push debate on regulation significantly forwards. We’re proud to be playing a part in that.

All-in-all, it’s a busy time at OAX Foundation. We’re focused on delivering the OAX platform on time and on budget, and as that nears completion we’re redoubling our promotion efforts so more and more people know about what we do. Being at the heart of the debates on technology innovation and regulatory change is a critical part of our success.
