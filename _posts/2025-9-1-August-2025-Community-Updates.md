<br><b>August 2025 Community Updates</b>

<b>Ethereum Hits New ATH Amid ETF Frenzy and Altcoin Stir</b>

In August 2025, the cryptocurrency market showed no signs of cooling after a blockbuster month that saw <b>Ethereum (ETH)</b> etch a fresh all-time high, the overall market capitalization eclipse <b>$4 trillion</b>, and signs of an impending altcoin rally emerge. <b>Bitcoin</b>'s dominance slipped below 60%, potentially heralding a broader altseason, while institutional adoption via <b>digital asset treasuries (DAT)</b> continued to pour fuel on the fire. 

At the <b>Bitcoin Asia conference</b> in Hong Kong, attendees buzzed with optimism, expressing the sector's resilience amid macroeconomic tailwinds. With the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision looming this month, analysts eye potential cuts that could propel crypto into a strong Q4 finish.

<b>BitcoinAsia Renowned Global Conference</b>

The <b>OAX Foundation</b> was thrilled to participate in <b>Bitcoin Asia 2025</b>, held August 28–29 in Hong Kong for the second time. The event drew over 15,000 attendees, solidifying its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin conference. Featuring prominent speakers such as <b>Eric Trump</b>, <b>Simon Gerovich</b>, <b>CZ</b>, <b>Yat Siu</b>, and <b>Adam Back</b> among over 200 others, the summit was live-streamed by <b>Bitcoin Magazine</b> and <b>BitcoinConfAsia</b>.

Over two days, the conference covered a wide range of topics, from institutional adoption and mining to development and macro policy. Hearing firsthand from industry leaders about <b>Bitcoin</b> and broader cryptocurrency adoption was particularly valuable, especially given the tremendous growth observed in the past 10 months. The sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish, with Eric Trump making bold predictions that Bitcoin reaching 1 million and beyond is imminent. While many ideas are still in their infancy, the likelihood of these speculations are increasing.

<b>Key Agenda at Bitcoin Asia</b>

<b>Bitcoin’s Scalability and Decentralization</b>

Bitcoin’s scalability remains challenged by its limited capacity and past block size debates. Innovations like <b>Ordinals</b>, <b>Runes</b>, <b>BRC-20</b>, and <b>Layer 2 solutions</b>, inspired by successes seen in Ethereum's ecosystem such as <b>Ethena</b>, were key discussion points at the <b>Bitcoin Summit</b>.

<b>Crypto Treasury Strategies in Asia</b>

<b>Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs)</b> are gaining traction over crypto ETFs for their liquidity and flexibility, with <b>Dr. Xiao Feng (HashKey)</b> highlighting their role in driving adoption. <b>Japan’s</b> high crypto tax pushes firms toward stock-based Bitcoin holdings, while Hong Kong and Thailand support DAT growth through accessible financial structures and retail trading.

<b>Adoption and Policy</b>

Bitcoin adoption in Asia is growing, with Korea’s <b>BitPlanet</b> announcing a $40M treasury purchase and pro-Bitcoin policies emerging in <b>Singapore</b>, <b>Pakistan</b>, <b>Hong Kong</b>, and the U.S. Regulatory challenges in Asia, particularly Hong Kong, complicate crypto treasury companies, pushing projects toward U.S. IPOs under favorable Trump administration policies.

<b>Community and AI</b>

While Bitcoin Asia was surely the show of the month, our AI initiative did not stop brewing in the background. The way we see AI is not only how it’s integrated into our lives, but also how it can expedite the ability to build with vibe coding making it ever so accessible for people from non-technical backgrounds to spin up demos in a matter of weeks. If Bitcoin is redefining our finances, AI is redefining how we work. We’re pleased to see that our community is also actively adopting AI, and we can see that <b>Lovable</b>, no pun intended, is the most lovable vibe coding platform in our community, followed by <b>Replit</b>.

<b>Wrapping up</b>

The OAX Foundation is thrilled to participate in these thought-provoking discussions at Bitcoin Asia 2025. Bitcoin’s adoption is undeniable, but its full potential and ultimate impact remain uncertain. One thing is clear: advocates are driving progress on all fronts, from lobbying governments and policymakers to developing institutional-grade technology and advancing digital financial literacy for the future. 

In our upcoming blogs, we will continue our deep dive into Bitcoin’s growth drivers and Digital Asset Treasuries, aiming to demystify these trends following on from <a href="https://www.oax.org/2025/08/21/Part-One-of-a-Deep-Dive-into-The-Bitcoin-Ecosystem.html">part one</a>. On the AI front, we will be exploring its development in Asia. Stay tuned!
