While our team gear up for next month’s Consensus conference in New York, this is far from the only item in the OAX Foundation’s event calendar. In about two weeks’ time, we will be taking part in an internal roadshow hosted by the global markets team at one of Hong Kong’s major banks. Call this a rehearsal for the main event!

OAX is both honored and excited to be one of the few external parties to be given the chance to showcase their projects and products to the bank’s teams of sales-traders, support staff and IT professionals. This is a fantastic opportunity for us to gain exposure to the mainstream banking and finance community.

At the event, which will be centered on the latest development in digital trading tools, we will demo the concept and technology behind the OAX platform. In particular, we will focus on how the decentralized order book, powered by the Ethereum Whisper mechanism, helps distinguish OAX from the other decentralized exchange platforms. 

Our audience at the event — many of whom are traders of different asset classes, will not be strangers to such concepts, as it shares similar principles to the tools that they use for trading, such as the instant messaging systems or chatrooms on various financial data terminals. Their feedback will certainly add new perspectives to our project. 

Stay tuned for our post-event wrap up and other updates from the OAX Foundation. If you want to talk to us about any aspect of the project, please feel free to get in touch via [communitymgmt@oax.org](mailto:communitymgmt@oax.org).
