In our two previous blog posts, we talked about our community is incredibly diverse with a large number of contributors. During a record breaking token sale, we passed the soft cap in 10 minutes and hit 15 million dollars in under 3 hours, however, for us, having a strong user base was really what we were hoping for. We’d like to once again thank those of you who contributed, and remind everyone that our Token Sale is still kicking. We really appreciate you guys!

To show our appreciation, we’d like to tell everyone that communicating and engaging with the community is one of our top priorities. We have the openANX bitcointalk ANN thread, White Paper, and other materials in multiple languages to communicate with as many people as possible. We also held a “Community Blitz — 5 Cities in 5 days” event, where the team visited Chengdu, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore to spread the word about openANX. Photos and a quick recap of the Seoul event can be seen in a previous [post](https://keepingstock.net/throwback-to-the-seoul-event-eab56fddfc53).

Also, Hugh Madden, Technical Director of openANX, answered enquiries from an audience during an Ask Me Anything(AMA) session on Monday night, cracking technical questions and resolving doubts. You can see it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/6imxdj/log_of_ama_with_openanx/).

In the future a global tour awaits. The team is committed to really working with the community.

In addition, we manage multiple Social Media channels including Slack, Twitter, Reddit, and more. We try to answer questions from the community as quickly and as accurately as possible. We apologize in advance if we can’t answer something quickly. Please understand that our responses often have to be checked by multiple people within the team. Thankfully, our efforts don’t seem to be in vain, as some people have expressed their appreciation. In the bitcointalk ANN thread, a user wrote

_“Thanks very much ANX Marketing for your detailed response to my questions. It provided some good clarity.”_

In response to our user guide, a user on Reddit wrote

_“Nice instructions, no problems when contributing and tokens received instantly. Nice to have a working ICO for a change :D.”_

Because of our strong user base, openANX came second in a poll asking about upcoming ICOs.

To continue and improve our community engagement, we’d like to ask for your help. As the project develops, we will be creating more formalized chat groups. At this moment though, we’d really appreciate it if you could just share your experiences with us. We want to hear about:

1. How/Why you got involved in the project.

2. Previous experiences, good or bad, with centralized or decentralized exchanges.

3. Why you’re excited about openANX

4. How we can best communicate with the community; which methods are the best? i.e. Twitter, Reddit, bitcointalk thread, project website, Slack, Medium blogs such as this one, etc.

5. Any concerns? Which things the team can improve upon?

Besides these topics, we’re open to hear anything you have to say. Please email us at [marketing@openanx.org](marketing@openanx.org). If we get a good number of responses, we will do a follow-up blog covering some of your responses.

Establishing trust for a trustless technology and trading platform is no small task. A continuous effort to educate participants and raise awareness of a better way of cryptocurrency trading (i.e. openANX with its innovative features of aggregated liquidity, collateralised asset gateways and an off-chain dispute resolution mechanism) will be critical to the growth of this platform.

Thank you for your continued support everyone! Please remember the community is yours just as much as it is anyone else’s.
