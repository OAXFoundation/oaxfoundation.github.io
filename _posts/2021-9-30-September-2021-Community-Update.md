<b>September 2021 Community Update</b><br>

<br>As we head into the last quarter of 2021, the news from the crypto industry doesn’t seem to be slowing down in the least. We wrote a post about <a href="https://www.oax.org/2021/09/14/The-Evolving-Hack.html">the evolving hack</a> earlier this month, and shortly after posting, reports of an (unsuccessful) attack on the ETH chain was reported, while the likes of Solana and Arbitrum experienced disruptions. Governments have also been making their own headlines, with news coming out of El Salvador and China making big waves. While governments have been weighing in on either end of the spectrum in this digital asset debate, we take a look at <a href="https://www.oax.org/2021/09/23/DeFi-Trends-for-Q4-2021.html">DeFi trends</a> in this quarter; one of which may help to address some of the concerns that governments and regulators face. Can we expect that trend to take over because of the necessity in dealing with the concerns of regulators, or will other trends like NFT or GameFi push ahead because it appeals to the larger community? Only time will tell, but you can be sure that we’ll be watching very carefully and talking about it, so join in on our conversation!<br><br>
