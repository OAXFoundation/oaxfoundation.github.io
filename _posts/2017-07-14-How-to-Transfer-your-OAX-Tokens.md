A week ago I posted here with details of how to “Register to Activate your OAX Tokens” As we get closer to the 29th July, we are getting a lot of questions so I thought it would be worthwhile to post again just to remind people and answer some of the frequently asked questions about Registration.

##### I have backed many ICO’s and this is the first one I’ve had to register for, why is that?

As I have mentioned in other posts, we are trying to build a community. We are not simply raising funds as the end goal. We want to develop an amazing platform that is useful and of benefit to the users. To do that, we need to build a strong, active community. So, we’d like to be able to keep in contact with our backers and supporters and keep them informed of developments. We also need to be able to contact any contributor who may need to submit additional information for KYC purposes.

##### Why Do I Need To Register to Activate My Tokens?

To ensure that we can keep in touch with our backers, we’d like to collect an email address from everyone to allow us to communicate project developments, news and upcoming events. Linking an email address to the contribution address also allows us to confirm if we require any additional details from any backer in order to comply with KYC/AML requirements. If we have an email address we can contact you easily.

##### Why Do You Need To Do KYC?

At openANX, we are very committed to the long term development of the platform and its widespread adoption and use. We are trying to build something important, that is functional and changes the nature of crypto-exchanges for the better. To remain viable long term, we need to ensure we follow regulations and compliance as they are presented to us by our legal counsel.

##### How Do I Register?

It’s very simple. Just go to the website ([www.openanx.org](www.openanx.org)) and CLICK the REGISTER button on the Homepage.

Or you can go [here](https://registration.openanx.org/) directly.

Register early to ensure that your tokens are ready to transfer on the 29th July.
