Thank you for testing the OAX prototype. We are hosting an online AMA (Ask Me Anything) on the OAX Telegram channel between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm (Hong Kong Time), July 5, 2018 to gather feedback and answer questions from the community.

During the session we will be dropping tokens to qualified participants*! (More details to follow)

To help us prepare, we are inviting you to leave questions on this post between now and 12:00pm HKT, July 3. We will award tokens to three questions with the most Up-votes (Top prize: 200 tokens; Second prize: 100 tokens; Third Prize: 50 tokens). Be sure to invite others to vote for your questions!

*To win the tokens, participants need to complete a special task to be unveiled prior to the event. The OAX Foundation reserves the right to change the conditions of the campaign.
