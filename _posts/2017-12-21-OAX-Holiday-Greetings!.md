Dear Sir/Madam,

Greetings from the OAX Team. 2017 has been a fruitful and busy year and we would like to send our best regards to all of you that have been supporting the project. Whether you are a token holder, a member of our working group, or merely a vocal supporter on our social media, we would not have achieved the success we enjoy today without any of you. We wish you all the joy and happiness in this holiday season. And as we approach the end of 2017, let’s take a trip down some of OAX’s highlights this year:

##### First Working Group Meeting
The first monthly Working Group meeting was successfully held in November. We brought together some key industry stakeholders from leading accountancy and professional services firms including PwC Hong Kong, EY, and King & Wood Mallesons, one of Hong Kong’s top digital asset legal firms. The meeting set the foundation of integrating best practices in compliance, KYC, the holding and security of funds and other critical areas into the OAX platform.

##### Shanghai Finwise Global Blockchain Summit
Hugh Madden, our technical director, introduced OAX to the Chinese community and talked about the project in Shanghai at a blockchain conference. Not only did Hugh promote OAX to over 2,000 guests at the summit, he also met with members of the OAX community and further strengthen our engagement with our supporters.

##### The Moscow Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference
Our marketing team had the pleasure to visit Moscow and talked about the need for a paradigm shift in the exchange business. The full recap has been posted [here](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/moscow-blockchain-recap-1f9b14a8becf), where we shared our thoughts on understanding asset gateways and the positive impact regulation could play in crypto.

##### New team
We welcome our new General Manager, Amanda Liu. Amanda is going to lead the team with her decades of invaluable experience in investment and corporate banking. Winnie Mak has joined us as the Executive Director of Corporate Finance with her extensive experience in equity research and investment. Our Senior Advisor, William Barkshire, had engaged in senior roles within major exchanges in Asia, Europe, and North America. We will have another senior lawyer joining the team in 2018. With the technical advice from Enuma, our team will continue to deliver under our three pillars: technology, regulatory and community. New members onboard announcement can be found [here](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/moscow-blockchain-recap-1f9b14a8becf).

Finally, we would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We’ll continue our endeavour in 2018 and we thank you again for showing interest and support to the [OAX community](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/moscow-blockchain-recap-1f9b14a8becf).

Best regards,

OAX Team
