Consensus is just over a month away now and our preparations are in full swing! We’re planning to pack a lot in over the three days. Here’s a flavour of what’ll be on offer at booth 217.

First and foremost our leadership team will be out in force, including our co-founders, technology development heads and business development leads. They’ll be there telling the OAX story and describing our progress to date, as well as what’s coming up in the next phase of the project. As you’ll all know, the great and the good of the digital asset world will be there so this is an important chance for us to renew old connections and gain new supporters for the work we’re doing.

We’ll also have new videos on display explaining the OAX project and the technology behind it. These will be accompanied by demos — so this is a real chance to get more informed about the purpose of the project and how we’re going about building it. Last but not least, we’ll have plenty of OAX branded giveaways for you to take, so you can show your support for OAX wherever you are!

If you want to book some time to talk about any aspect of the project with our leaders, please feel free to get in touch via [communitymgmt@oax.org](mailto:communitymgmt@oax.org). Even if you don’t have time for a meeting we’d love you to drop by and say hi.

We're are looking forward to seeing you in New York!
