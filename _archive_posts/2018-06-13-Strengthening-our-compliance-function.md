This week Ivan Wong joined the team as Senior Vice President, Money Laundering Reporting Officer. Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations is a crucial part of any business operating in financial services, and particularly so in the fast-evolving digital asset industry.

As you’ll all be aware, regulations differ in every jurisdiction and are updated regularly, so it’s critical that an organization like ours remains on top of the latest developments. Strict compliance controls also form a cornerstone of the platform we’re developing — we want to promote the strongest governance standards to help drive adoption of the OAX platform and trust in the system overall.

Ivan will be helping us do just that. He joins from China Merchants Asset Management (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd, where he was Senior Compliance Manager — Legal and Compliance. He’s also worked for both local and international banks, including Kookmin Bank, South Korea’s leading commercial bank. In these roles, he’s run compliance and AML functions, leading teams and setting up policies as well as advising on banking licences. Ivan is also well used to dealing with regulators on a wide range of issues.

He’ll be bringing all this experience to our work at the OAX Foundation, strengthening our compliance function and helping us set a standard for the industry to follow. We’re already building a reputation for our understanding of the regulatory environment for digital assets, as shown by our General Counsel Paul’s [speech](https://www.oax.org/en/newss/dc909ef6a377) last week to the Law Society of Hong Kong. With Ivan as part of the team, we’re now even better positioned to help take our industry forwards.
