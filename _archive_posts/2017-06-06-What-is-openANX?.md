##### What is openANX?

The openANX platform will take advantage of technical developments on the Ethereum blockchain such as payment channels (Raiden, 0x, Swap, ERC20) and utilize them to overcome the challenges faced by the current CEM. It will co-opt the strengths of the existing model to improve the existent decentralized exchange attempts by linking existing exchange platforms (“Asset Gateways”) to the network and enforcing a collateralized deposit system that will provide users with a way to measure risk. It will also provide an off-chain, legally enforceable dispute resolution system to provide much needed consumer protection.

The key deliverables of openANX are to:

• Migrate existing exchanges to the role of collateralized Asset Gateways, bridging fiat to tokens in a collateralized, transparent manner

• Provide credit risk trading to allow price discovery and a market “voice” of gateway creditworthiness

• Provide dispute resolution to access collateral in the event of disputes

• Aggregate order books using ANX International (“ANX”)’s proprietary “aggregation liquidity IP”, and merging the liquidity of participating Asset Gateways

• Complement the wave of “token only” decentralized matching engine projects which otherwise would not have fiat support, and hence further increase liquidity, and accessibility for the general public

• Both order book and Peer-to-Peer (“P2P) Over the Counter (“OTC”) order matching

• Migrate ANX International’s existing user base to the new platform, ensuring a critical mass of initial users; and then growing a consortium of new and existing exchanges committed to migrating to the openANX platform
