The airdrop application period has officially closed! We’d like to thank everyone who’s signed up. Over the coming days and weeks we’ll be performing the necessary due diligence and KYC checks to confirm participants’ eligibility and the precise number of tokens they’ll receive. If you’re one of the many supporters who’ve registered for the airdrop, stay tuned for more information.

We announced this airdrop back in July last year, right after successfully launching the prototype of the OAX platform. We have made a lot of progress since then. In December, we announced that our platform has achieved speeds of over 1,000 transactions per second (TPS) per node. This airdrop is all about rewarding our loyal followers for their commitment to the project and so we’re really glad that the process has been marked by significant developments at its beginning and end.

In the meantime, congratulations to all those of you who were successful in the airdrop and a big thank you for your support. If you’d like a reminder about the terms of the airdrop and how it’s being structured, more information is available [here](https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-airdrop-details-1f6aaef3bf1a).
