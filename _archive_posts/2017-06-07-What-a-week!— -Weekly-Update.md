It’s been an exciting week here at openANX, we’ve had some additional advisors come onboard, we’ve announced our attendance at BTC123’s Chengdu blockchain conference and we’re holding our own event in Shenzhen this Friday! All systems are going!

If you are interested in the Shenzhen event, join any of our WeChat channels for more details.

We are also working hard with the community to get the word out and answer any questions people might have about the project, the platform or the team. Our numbers are growing everyday!

We also had a quick chat with one of our advisors, Zane Tackett, who is pretty well known in the wider community about his background and how he got involved in openANX.
