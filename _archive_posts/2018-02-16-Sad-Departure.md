We are sad to announce that Liam Bussell, who led OAXâ€™s marketing and branding effort during the past year, has decided to pursue other opportunities.

Liam as been an integral part of the OAX project since its launch phase and his contribution is well recognised. We wish him well and success in his future endeavours.
