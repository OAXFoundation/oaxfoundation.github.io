##### openANX, OAX and the Open ANX Foundation — What is the difference?

openANX is the name of the platform and project. It provides advantages such as aggregated order books, transparent collateral and credit risk markets. It is the real-world application of decentralized exchanges.

OAX is the name for the ERC20 tokens that are used (e.g. to acquire memberships) on the openANX platform

Open ANX Foundation is the name of the non-profit incorporated in Hong Kong

##### What is a centralized exchange and what advantages/disadvantages does it have?

Most existing traditional exchanges today are centralized exchanges, meaning there is a single entity that controls the exchange. Centralized exchanges have some advantages such as providing critical services, liquidity and banking relationships. However, there are major disadvantages such as a lack of financial and operational transparency, and security concerns as demonstrated by hacked exchanges that resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars as well as trust and confidence from users and the general public. Trading on centralized exchanges also defeats the purpose of having decentralized currencies (Bitcoin, alternative cryptocurrencies).

The term exchange is somewhat misleading in the traditional sense — i.e. on stock exchanges or online marketplace platforms, at the end of a transaction there is the delivery of the purchased goods as well as the transfer of payments. On a crypto centralized “exchange” there is no payment or coin changing hands amongst buyers and sellers (and hence why the transaction is not recorded on the blockchain); rather the transaction is reflected only on the internal accounting records of the exchange and a selling customer that previously was owed coins by the exchange is now owed fiat currency instead. As he still does not hold physical possession, his account is essentially an IOU issued by the exchange to the seller.

##### What are decentralized exchanges (DEX)?

Decentralized exchanges are the proposed solution to the problems faced by centralized exchanges and their users. While current decentralized exchanges are a step in the right direction, they often suffer problems such as low volume and liquidity due to the lack of integration of the strengths and key functions of centralized exchanges.

DEX do not have integrated banking relationships nor integrated onramp/offramp payment channels, thus fiat trading is not possible on the platform, and it only allows trading of crypto pairs which severely limits trading activity. They are much less practical for users unless they already have crypto assets and are not seeking to monetize into fiat.

##### How does openANX differ from other decentralized exchanges (DEX)?

Firstly, and most importantly, openANX is complementary to decentralized exchanges. Many Ethereum initiatives such as 0x, RAIDEN, SWAP, will support trustless trading of Ethereum tokens. However, they don’t solve the problem of onboarding and offboarding real world funds. openANX provides an asset gateway mechanism to practically onboard and offboard real world currencies whilst affording consumer greater transparency and increased protection with collateral and a dispute resolution process. The fiat currencies safely tokenized by compatible asset gateways are essentially IOU representative tokens that can then be traded on other Ethereum decentralized exchanges.

##### Benefits of openANX

**• High Liquidity**

Many existing DEX suffer from low trade volumes which leads to low liquidity, owing to their “one trade per settlement” model: traders execute one trade and then must wait for the real-world currency settlement before being able to trade again, during which the traders are exposed to counterparty credit and settlement risks. With the provision of a safe tokenization process on openANX, traders will be able to onboard funds and trade multiple times before offboarding; this is crucial for the market makers and arbitrage traders that provide critical levels of liquidity

Additionally, existing centralized and decentralized exchanges operate using fragmented liquidity pools. openANX aggregates the liquidity from each of its asset gateway participants to provide a sufficient level of liquidity. This also lowers the barrier to entry for new asset gateways as they will have access to the overall openANX liquidity pool.

Finally, existing DEX fail to adequately provide transparency on the explicit counter party credit risk associated with asset gateways. openANX allows asset gateways tokens to be traded against each other’s, providing a market for credit risk, which results in numerous advantages such as opportunity for hedging credit risk and allowing the explicit pricing of credit risk be to expressed by the market (price discovery).

**• Transparency**

The cryptocurrency community is wary of government regulations (despite the accompanying safety net), yet would still like to have a transparent guarantee of their assets. Existing centralized and decentralized exchanges do not address this need due to their lack of financial or operational transparency. The openANX platform will be open source and governed by a DAO/non-profit “Open ANX Foundation”, and it will function as the ‘decentralized exchange between exchanges’. This being open source and valuing transparency allows the openANX project to stay true to the movement of decentralization.

**• Credit risk**

On the openANX platform, asset gateways fulfil the role of holding customer funds under custody and issuing IOU representative tokens on the blockchain. The gateways should still hold the customer funds in an appropriate, segregated account, however the gateway can also post locked up collateral on the openANX DAO. This collateral is time locked and made available for dispute resolution. In this fashion, customers have addition, transparent data available to determine the creditworthiness of the gateway (as a function of real world factors and collateral value, and amount of tokenized assets).

Asset gateway tokens can then be traded against each other, with a premium or discount, representing perceived credit risk; this creates a market and price discovery mechanism for credit risk

Risk assessment is impossible without access to various data about the asset gateway. The exchange models available currently do not provide this information, therefore traders and users cannot price risk. On the openANX platform, the replacement of exchange IOUs with fiat tokens and the availability of information to evaluate risk (collateral, market value of token, credit risk factors etc.) enables traders to start factoring in risk in their trades.

##### What is an asset gateway? 

An asset gateway takes off-chain assets from customers, and mints an on-chain ERC20 token equivalent. Amongst other requirements, an asset gateway should:

• Post some amount of locked collateral into the openANX DAO,

• Incorporate acceptance of the openANX dispute resolution process into its customer terms and conditions, and

• Pre-declare its KYC and AML policy and nominate the KYC/AML contract that is used to enforce its regulatory obligations on the blockchain

##### What is the DAO and how does it interact with the openANX platform?

DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization”, it functions using smart contracts on Ethereum. openANX abides by the DAO, which is governed by the voters on the platform. This is one of the many strengths of the openANX platform — the governance is decentralized and can mould the way the platform behaves and develops.

##### What is an aggregated order book? 

Current centralized exchanges have isolated order books that don’t communicate with each other. This creates a problem in that the barrier for entry is high, and it leads to only a few exchanges maintaining and attracting sufficient liquidity. Using the “Liquidity Aggregation” technology provided by ANX, the openANX platform can aggregate all the order books so the end user can interact with a single, seamless order book that has the combined volume and liquidity from all asset gateways.

##### What is the distinction between the non-profit Open ANX Foundation and ANX International? 

The Open ANX Foundation and ANX International are separate entities. ANX will contribute proprietary IP to kick-start the openANX platform. Maintenance and funding for the openANX platform will be performed by the non-profit Open ANX Foundation. Post-launch, ANX will merely be an asset gateway and supplier on the openANX platform. Other suppliers can be selected by the DAO governance board.

##### What is the credit risk market? 

Tokenized representations of fiat currencies are provided to asset gateway users, replacing traditional IOUs from centralized exchanges. Since participants can make quantitative risk assessment from the data provided by the transparent nature of the openANX platform, the value of the fiat currency token provided by different asset gateways can change. Since participants have ownership of these tokens, they can be traded against each other and therefore long risk positions can be closed. This creates a new market dynamic — the credit risk market.
