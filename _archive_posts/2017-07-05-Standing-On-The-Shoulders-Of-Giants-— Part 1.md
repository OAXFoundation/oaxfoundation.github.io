Today I wanted to change pace a little, and talk about one thing we learned from the openANX Token Sale and the 3 months before it. We simply could not have achieved the success we did without and excellent team of advisors, backers and community. Below is one example, a release from  our legal advisors at L&Y Hong Kong, who really helped us thoughout the whole project.

Thanks  very much for all the support Henry, Keith, Max, Lisa, Tina and the whole team at L&Y!
