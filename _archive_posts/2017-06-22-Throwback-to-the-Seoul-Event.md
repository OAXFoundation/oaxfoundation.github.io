With all the OAX Token Sale news lately, we’d like to take a break and share what happened at our Seoul event on Tuesday. Over 150 people signed up for the event in just five days! This was just one of the five cities the openANX team visited in its “Community Blitz — 5 Cities in 5 Days” campaign.

We held the event at the COEX Center in Seoul, perhaps the most famous building in all of Korea.

The event kicked off with an introduction by Ken Lo, Leadership Team of openANX and CEO of ANX International.

Next we had a short presentation about the openANX platform.

_Presenting openANX!_

With the presentation fresh in everyone's minds, the audience took a short quiz on the openANX platform. After a Q&A session, everyone got together for some delicious Korean BBQ.
