We have officially kicked off our China Tour! From July 30–31, our team was at the Finwise Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai to get word out about the openANX project and meet our supporters. Over 2,500 people attended the Summit, and over 50 different teams, including OpenLedger, had a chance to present to the Finwise audience. Hugh Madden, Technology Director at the Open ANX Foundation, presented on our behalf.

We also gave out some cool souvenirs, including recycling bags, electric fans, and towels, to our supporters.

Hugh also had a chance to meet some of our most devoted supporters in one-on-one meetings. Many of them asked technical questions about the project, as well as questions about developmental progress, and Hugh did his best to answer all of them.

All in all, we gained around 500 followers across our Chinese social media channels. This event was also a great opportunity to consolidate our already-strong community in China and address some of the questions that they had about the project.

Everyone on the team was really happy with how the event turned out! We have some more trips planned for our China Tour in the coming months. As always, we’ll keep you posted once we have more information about them.
