Hi everyone,

It’s been an amazing few days, the openANX project has received huge and overwhelming support from the community!

“**The OpenANX Foundation is the most credible attempt** I’ve seen at leading the effort to deliver on this mission in the years I’ve been thinking about this problem. **The underlying idea and structure look promising, but perhaps more importantly, the team behind it is the right team to take on this challenge.**”

Recently, ICO Alert has also published a detailed report on openANX.

_“openANX is, not unlike Bancor, a protocol that is likely to be vital for the crypto world on the medium term, and will greatly enhance the viability of many existing organizations in the crypto space today. The prospect of a sort of ‘marketplace for exchanges’ is exciting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the simplified implementation of rating and auditing organizations that can help enhance user protections driven by organic demand rather than overt government intervention.”_
