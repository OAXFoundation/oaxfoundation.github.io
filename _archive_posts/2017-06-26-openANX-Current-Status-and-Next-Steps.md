At this stage, we'd like to thank everyone for their suppport of the openANX project and their help in making it the most successful Asian token sale in history! We raised $17 million dollars in hald the tiem that QTUM did, and have a larger community than many other projects recently. Some people have asked how long we will keep the sale open, and for us the decision is not difficult. 

First and foremost, we are trying to build a community. When the platform launches, our key idea will be to get users engaged and interested in making a positive change in the crypto-community and the way it operates. For that, we need a community that is large and vibrant. It is not about the money, now that we have comfortably passed the soft cap (and did in ten minutes) our main goal is to drive users to be interested in the project and its development.

If we compare to recent projects and total number of contributors;

**BAT: 184**

**Golem: 522**

**Gnosis: 623**

**TokenCard: 2,264**

**openANX: < 3,300!**

_Join The Community!_

This is a great achievement, and shows us that our community is both large, and global. **We have over 1,000 backers who contributed 1.5 ETH or less!** This is great! We have kept the Contributions open for 4 days because we believe even a participant who comes in with 0.5 ETH deserves a chance to be involved, and these guys are still coming onboard.

We also have some news regarding next steps; We have begun forming a **Working Group of exchanges** and are in discussions with a number of participants, names you will certainly recognize! Once details are final we will release them via the website and social media.
