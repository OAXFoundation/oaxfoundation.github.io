As of this blog post, over 75% of the allotted 30 million OAX tokens have been sold. The Token Sale has raised over $17 million USD in just a few days!

_That was fast!_

Within a few hours of the Token sale on June 22, the soft cap of 13 million OAX was met. Now, with over 75% sold, the sale may end much sooner than the original July 21 closing date. 

If all 30 million OAX tokens are sold, there is virtually no way to attain any OAX Tokens until the second Token Sale, which is expected to be held in 2018. If you believe in the project and still haven’t gotten any tokens yet, you know what to do!

A great aspect of the Token Sale so far has been the amount of participants (based on number of transactions). Instead of “whales” buying huge sums, there has been a constant stream of small purchases from many different participants. Compared to 600 participants for Golem and 210 participants for BATS, there have been over 3,800 different participants in the OAX Token Sale. This can only mean good things for the growth of the community, and the openANX project as a whole.

With the successful Token Sale launch, openANX has been in the news a lot lately. Here are some of the news articles:
