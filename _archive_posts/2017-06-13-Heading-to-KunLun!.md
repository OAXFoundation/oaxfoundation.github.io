The openANX team will be talking to people there and getting word out about the project with the over 2,000 people who’ll be in attendance. We might even take a selfie with Vitalik!

_Selfie madness!_

In all seriousness though, we will be launching our technical white paper at the conference and we are very keen to get the feedback from the community. We’ll launch it first on our Slack. You can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/openanx/shared_invite/MTk1NjQ2NjI2MTEyLTE0OTcyNzY3MjEtMTA3YTFkM2Q3ZA).

We are keen to get the word out, and to share our ideas about the Asset Gateway Model and a decentralized future. If you have any questions, come talk to us! If you’d like to drop past booth D6 to talk to us and get a free t-shirt, please do.
