This week we return to regular programming with a view of “What’s Happening?” in a couple of the communities our supporters are in. These regular posts aim to give a snapshot view of current trends, opinions and news in different markets as a way to educate and inform. This week we will start with BV and his write up of the Ukraine. This is an absolutely killer post, with a lot of info and detail. I suggest if you like him, you find Bitvoyager on our channels and give him a “Thumbs Up”
