On Saturday 24 November Professor Syren Johnstone will be hosting a conference at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to launch the first of his research papers into cryptocurrency regulation, and OAX Foundation will be there as speakers and breakfast sponsor. This event looks set to be an important contribution to the ongoing debate about what the future shape of our industry should be.

Representatives from the FinTech Association of Hong Kong and other industry bodies, as well as from across the digital asset industry, will come together to debate the right way to regulate crypto. Our Co-founder and Director Dave Chapman, and General Counsel Paul Li will be appearing on the panel discussions that form the centrepiece of the agenda. Regular followers will know Paul has spoken many times before about the challenge cryptocurrencies and decentralization pose the regulators. This conference will be a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate our commitment to open and transparent discussion of the issues.

It’ll also be another opportunity to promote the OAX project and our firm belief in the future of decentralization, following hard on the heels of our participation in Hong Kong FinTech Week and numerous other events. And it’s not all we’ve got planned — coming up in December we’ll be participating in another major event. We’re working on the details of this and will share them with you as soon as they’re finalised.

We’re excited about the activity we’ve got coming up over the next few months and are certainly not slowing down for the end of the year! 2019 will be critically important for us with the go-live of the full platform, so we’re fully focused on keeping up the momentum both on the project and our promotional activities.
