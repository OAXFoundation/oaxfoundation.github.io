We are starting our bug bounty program for all contracts and software relevant for our upcoming token launch. Read more about our Token launch mechanics [here](https://github.com/openanx/OpenANXToken)

Major bugs will be rewarded up to 5000 OAX tokens. Much higher rewards are possible (up to 10000 OAX tokens) in case of very severe vulnerabilities. The bounty program will be capped at 50000 OAX tokens.

Most of the rules on [https://bounty.ethereum.org](https://bounty.ethereum.org) apply. For example: First come, first serve. Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known (such as [these](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis-contracts/issues)) to the team are not eligible for bounty rewards.
