What a night! The OAX team was in Seoul this past Friday to present at the Seoul Ethereum Meetup. It is a key aim of the project team to get out, meet the community, discuss the project, and answer questions; the Korean crowd had some great questions!
 
To start the event, the team gave out some free OAX t-shirts to the audience.

We had brought around 100 t-shirts, thinking they would be more than enough, but every single one of them flew off the shelves. By the end of the event, people were asking if we had any extra shirts. Some people liked the t-shirts so much that they changed into them during the event!

Michael Oved from the AirSwap team was the first to present. Their idea about a peer-to-peer, decentralized ERC20 token trading ecosystem sounds great, and we wish them the best of luck on their project. Sam Tabar from AirSwap’s Strategy Team also attended the event.

Our own Hugh Madden, Technology Director of the Open ANX Foundation, went up next to present. Hugh talked about the inner workings of the OAX platform, future project plans, and the current problems of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Hugh also went deep into the technical parts of the project, as well as on payment channels like Raiden and 0x. One area that raised a lot of interest was around the functional aspects of asset gateways, and the costs inherent in the centralized exchange model, with lots of questions and discussion about how the platform could benefit existing exchanges and why they may want to join the project.

We would like to thank the meetup organizers for giving us the opportunity to speak about our project. We definitely feel like we gained some supporters, while consolidating the supporters we already have.

We have more events like this one planned in the very near future. Please follow our social media channels for updates.
