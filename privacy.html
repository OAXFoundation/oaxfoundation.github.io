<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we protect and store your information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.&nbsp; We offer the use of a secure server.&nbsp; All personal information provided to us is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our database, which can only be accessed by those with special access rights to our systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also take steps to monitor access to and modification of your information by our contractors, advisers, consultants and staff members, and ensure that they are aware of and properly trained in their obligations for managing your privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We generally store the personal information that we collect in electronic databases, some of which may be held on our behalf by third party data storage providers.&nbsp; Sometimes we also keep hard copy records of this personal information in physical storage facilities.&nbsp; Unless required by legal or regulatory obligations, we will not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose of collection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we use cookies?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we use cookies to help us remember and understand your preferences for future visits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are small text files created and stored on your hard drive by your internet browser software, in order to hold relevant information and the webpage you are currently viewing.&nbsp; Most internet browsers have a facility that will allow you to disable cookies altogether &ndash; please refer to your browser&rsquo;s help menu to find out how to do this.&nbsp; While you will still be able to browse our websites with cookies disabled on your internet browser, some website functionality may not be available or may not function correctly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we disclose any personal information to third parties?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not sell or trade your personally identifiable information to any third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share personal information about you with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>your representatives, advisers and others you have authorised to interact with us on your behalf;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>our staff, contractors, advisors and consultants who need the information to discharge their duties for the purposes as described above;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>related entities to our foundation for the purposes described above;</li>
	<li>our business partners engaged in digital asset services and development;</li>
	<li>our agents and service providers that assist us in operating our website, providing products and services to you, or otherwise conducting our business;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>other parties for marketing and advertising uses; and &nbsp;</li>
	<li>government authorities who ask us to disclose that information, or to other people as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases the people to whom we disclose your personal information may be located overseas.&nbsp; Further, we may have servers located overseas. There may not be in place data protection laws which are substantially similar to, or serve the same purposes as the applicable data privacy laws in Hong Kong.&nbsp; This means your personal information may not be protected to the same or similar level in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access and correction&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to access any of the personal information that we hold about you or to correct some aspect of it (eg because you think it is incomplete or incorrect), please contact us using the contact details set out below.&nbsp; To protect the integrity and security of the information we hold, we may ask that you follow a defined access procedure, which may include steps to verify your identity.&nbsp; In certain cases we may charge you an administration fee for providing you with access to the information you have asked for, but we will inform you of this before proceeding.&nbsp; There may be cases where we are unable to provide the information you request, such as where it would interfere with the privacy of others or result in a breach of confidentiality.&nbsp; In these cases we will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you do not request access to and/or correct your personal information held by us, if we are satisfied that, having regard to the reasons for which we hold your personal information, that personal information is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading, we may take reasonable steps to correct that information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third party links</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include links to third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. Further, we do not verify their content.&nbsp; We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
