            OAX Foundation was founded in 2017 to explore the future of
            decentralized transactions of digital assets. As a digital solutions
            provider, OAX is committed to developing a scalable, secure,
            trustless technology for trading digital assets – a critical
            component of future markets, economies and societies.
            <br /><br />
            As the industry and its needs continue to evolve, so do we. OAX has
            remained committed to solving many of the fundamental problems that
            exist within the decentralized exchange space. In August 2019, OAX
            launched our Layer 2 Exchange (L2X) protocol to the open source
            community, as a possible solution to some of the areas of concern.
            <br /><br />
            Explore the segments below to learn about the progress we’ve made
            and insights to the industry at large.

            OAX Parachain Technology Summary
          </h3>
          <p class="post-excerpt">
            DeFi, built on the fundamental qualities of blockchain, has been
            demonstrating the potential of more practical use cases, with
            applications distributing rewards to stakeholders while remaining
            decentralized.
            <br /><br />
            By building on the Polkadot Network, we hope to align their vision
            for scalability and interoperability needed to ensure the mass
            adoption of digital assets. Find out why we chose to work with
            Polkadot and our plans for the OAX Parachain in the links below.

            The code for our Layer 2 Exchange (L2X) protocol is officially
            released, marking the completion of a major milestone for the
            project.
            <br /><br />
            Currently, digital asset trading either takes place on centralized
            exchanges, which have persistently proved vulnerable to hacking, or
            in decentralized environments, which have speed and governance
            issues. OAX Foundation, working with its development partner, Enuma
            Technologies, has built a trustless exchange platform that combines
            the best elements of each system.
